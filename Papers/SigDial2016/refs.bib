abstract = {Until now, speech synthesis has mainly involved reading-style speech. Today, however, text-to-speech systems must provide a variety of styles because users expect these interfaces to do more than just read information. If synthetic voices must be integrated into future technology, they must simulate the way people talk instead of the way people read. Existing knowledge about how disfluencies occur has made it possible to propose a general framework for synthesising disfluencies. We propose a model based on the definition of disfluency and the concept of underlying fluent sentences. The model incorporates the parameters of standard prosodic models for fluent speech with local modifications of prosodic parameters near the interruption point. The constituents of the local models for filled pauses are derived from the analysis corpus, and constituent's prosodic parameters are predicted via linear regression analysis. We also discuss the implementation details of the model when used in a real speech synthesis system. Objective and perceptual evaluations showed that the proposed models outperformed the baseline model. Perceptual evaluations of the system showed that it is possible to synthesise filled pauses without decreasing the overall naturalness of the system, and users stated that the speech produced is even more natural than the one produced without filled pauses. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Current dialogue systems generally oper- ate in a pipelined, modular fashion on one complete utterance at a time. Con- verging evidence shows that human un- derstanding operates incrementally and makes use of multiple sources of infor- mation during the parsing process, in- cluding traditionally “later” aspects such as pragmatics. We describe a spoken dia- logue system that understands language incrementally, gives visual feedback on possible referents during the course of the user's utterance, and allows for over- lapping speech and actions. We present findings from an empirical study showing that the resulting dialogue system is faster overall than its nonincremental counterpart. Furthermore, the incremental system is preferred to its counterpart – beyond what is accounted for by factors such as speed and accuracy. These results are the first to indicate, from a controlled user study, that successful incremental understanding systems will improve both performance and usability.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe an architecture for conversational systems that enables human-like performance along several important dimensions. First, interpretation is incremental, multi-level, and involves both general and task- and domain- specific knowledge. Second, generation is also incremental, proceeds in parallel with interpretation, and accounts for phenomena such as turn-taking, grounding and interrup- tions. Finally, the overall behavior of the system in the task at hand is determined by the (incremental) results of interpretation, the persistent goals and obligations of the system, and exogenous events of which it becomes aware. As a practical matter, the architecture supports a separation of responsibilities that enhances portability to new tasks and domains.},

abstract = {Two experiments explored the mapping between language and mental representations of visual scenes. In both experiments, participants viewed, for example, a scene depicting a woman, a wine glass and bottle on the floor, an empty table, and various other objects. In Experiment 1, participants concurrently heard either 'The woman will put the glass on the table' or 'The woman is too lazy to put the glass on the table'. Subsequently, with the scene unchanged, participants heard that the woman 'will pick up the bottle, and pour the wine carefully into the glass.' Experiment 2 was identical except that the scene was removed before the onset of the spoken language. In both cases, eye movements after 'pour' (anticipating the glass) and at 'glass' reflected the language-determined position of the glass, as either on the floor, or moved onto the table, even though the concurrent (Experiment 1) or prior (Experiment 2) scene showed the glass in its unmoved position on the floor. Language-mediated eye movements thus reflect the real-time mapping of language onto dynamically updateable event-based representations of concurrently or previously seen objects (and their locations). ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Spontaneous conversational speech has many characteristics that are currently not modelled well by HMM-based speech synthesis and in order to build synthetic voices that can give an impression of someone partaking in a conversation, we need to utilise data that exhibits more of the speech phenomena associated with conversations than the more generally used carefully read aloud sentences. In this paper we show that synthetic voices built with HMM-based speech synthesis techniques from conversational speech data, preserved segmental and prosodic characteristics of frequent conversational speech phenomena. An analysis of an evaluation investigating the perception of quality and speaking style of HMM-based voices confirms that speech with conversational characteristics are instrumental for listeners to perceive successful integration of conversational speech phenomena in synthetic speech. The achieved synthetic speech quality provides an encouraging start for the continued use of conversational speech in HMM-based speech synthesis. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Gaze aversion-the intentional redirection away from the face of an interlocutor-is an important nonverbal cue that serves a number of conversational functions, including signaling cognitive effort, regulating a conversation's intimacy level, and managing the conversational floor. In prior work, we developed a model of how gaze aversions are employed in conversation to perform these functions. In this paper, we extend the model to apply to conversational robots, enabling them to achieve some of these functions in conversations with people. We present a system that addresses the challenges of adapting human gaze aversion movements to a robot with very different affordances, such as a lack of articulated eyes. This system, implemented on the NAO platform, autonomously generates and combines three distinct types of robot head movements with different purposes: face-tracking movements to engage in mutual gaze, idle head motion to increase lifelikeness, and purposeful gaze aversions to achieve conversational functions. The results of a human-robot interaction study with 30 participants show that gaze aversions implemented with our approach are perceived as intentional, and robots can use gaze aversions to appear more thoughtful and effectively manage the conversational floor.},

It argues for a theory in which words get assigned both an intension and a type. The book develops a rich system of types and investigates its philosophical and formal implications, for example the abandonment of the classic Church analysis of types that has been used by linguists since Montague. The author integrates fascinating and puzzling observations about lexical meaning into a compositional semantic framework. Adjustments in types are a feature of the compositional process and account for various phenomena including coercion and copredication.

The fusion methods are described from the perspective of the basic concept, advantages, weaknesses, and their usage in various analysis tasks as reported in the literature. Moreover, several distinctive issues that influence a multimodal fusion process such as, the use of correlation and independence, confidence level, contextual information, synchronization between different modalities, and the optimal modality selection are also highlighted.

abstract = {Pointing was shown to focus attention in dialogue. Pairs of people talked and gestured to identify targets from arrays visible to both of them. Arrays were located at five distances: arm length (0 cm), 25 cm, 50 cm, 75 cm, and 100 cm. Some pairs could point; others could not. People relied more on pointing and less on language as distance decreased. Pointing especially suppressed descriptions of target location, suggesting that it was used to focus attention on a spatial region.},

abstract = {Word information is useful in natural language understanding. But in Chinese language processing, word information is not given natural. While word-segmentation works well for text in NLU, it deteriorates Chinese SLU because of the flexibility and distortion of spoken utterance plus ASR errors. This paper propose a novel approach, sub-word features, to take use word information and help understanding spoken utterance while retain the robustness of character-wise processing. By means of this approach, we can also effectively use named entity list to improve SLU performance. Experiments show that the sub-word features give an average of 0.7 improvement for ASR, and the usage of named list given an average of 4.7 improvement.},

abstract = {The human conceptual system contains knowledge that supports all cognitive activities, including perception, memory, language and thought. According to most current theories, states in modality-specific systems for perception, action and emotion do not represent knowledge – rather, redescriptions of these states in amodal representational languages do. Increasingly, however, researchers report that re-enactments of states in modality-specific systems underlie conceptual processing. In behavioral experiments, perceptual and motor variables consistently produce effects in conceptual tasks. In brain imaging experiments, conceptual processing consistently activates modality-specific brain areas. Theoretical research shows how modality-specific re-enactments could produce basic conceptual functions, such as the type–token distinction, categorical inference, productivity, propositions and abstract concepts. Together these empirical results and theoretical analyses implicate modality-specific systems in the representation and use of conceptual knowledge.},

Far beyond merely offering more options in terms of user interface, this trend may well usher in a genuine paradigm shift in man-machine communication. This contribution reviews the two major semantic interpretation frameworks underpinning natural language interaction, along with their respective advantages and drawbacks. It then discusses the choices made in Siri, Apple's personal assistant on the iOS platform, and speculates on how the current implementation might evolve in the near future to best mitigate any downside.},

This novel finding is discussed with respect to implications for the production process of speech and gestures.},

We present first insights from a corpus- based investigation of how gestures are used to regulate dialogue, and we provide first results from an account to capture these phenomena in agent- based communication simulations.

Graphical models are a flexible, concise, and expressive probabilistic modeling framework with which one may rapidly specify a vast collection of statistical models. This paper begins with a brief description of the representational and computational aspects of the framework. Following that is a detailed description of GMTK's features, including a language for specifying structures and probability distributions, logarithmic space exact training and decoding procedures, the concept of switching parents, and a generalized EM training method which allows arbitrary sub-Gaussian parameter tying. Taken together, these features endow GMTK with a degree of expressiveness and functionality that significantly complements other publically available packages. GMTK was recently used in the 2001 Johns Hopkins Summer Workshop, and experimental results are described in detail both herein and in a companion paper.},

In the development and evaluation of new methods, the question arises whether the empirically observed difference in performance is due to a genuine advantage of one system over the other, or just an effect of chance. However, many publications still do not concern themselves with the statistical significance of the results reported. We present a bootstrap method for significance analysis which is, at the same time, intuitive, precise and and easy to use. Unlike some methods, we make no (possibly ill-founded) approximations and the results are immediately interpretable in terms of word error rate.},

@book{boole1854investigation,
abstract = {First, in the realm of foundations, Boole reduced the four propositional forms of Aristotle's logic to formulas in the form of equations—by itself a revolutionary idea. Second, in the realm of logic's problems, Boole's addition of equation solving to logic—another revolutionary idea—involved Boole's doctrine that Aristotle's rules of inference (the “perfect syllogisms”) must be supplemented by rules for equation solving. Third, in the realm of applications, Boole's system could handle multi-term propositions and arguments whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle's system could not deduce “No quadrangle that is a square is a rectangle that is a rhombus” from “No square that is a quadrangle is a rhombus that is a rectangle” or from “No rhombus that is a rectangle is a square that is a quadrangle”. Boole's work founded the discipline of algebraic logic. It is often, but mistakenly, credited as being the source of what we know today as Boolean algebra. In fact, however, Boole's algebra differs from modern Boolean algebra: in Boole's algebra A+B cannot be interpreted by set union, due to the permissibility of uninterpretable terms in Boole's calculus. Therefore algebras on Boole's account cannot be interpreted by sets under the operations of union, intersection and complement, as is the case with modern Boolean algebra. The task of developing the modern account of Boolean algebra fell to Boole's successors in the tradition of algebraic logic (Jevons 1869, Peirce 1880, Jevons 1890, Schr{\"{o}}der 1890, Huntingdon 1904).},

abstract = {Three experiments examined the hypothesis that it preferentially refers to the most salient entity in a discourse, whereas that preferentially refers to a conceptual composite. In Experiment 1, eye movements were monitored as participants followed spoken instructions such as, Put the cup on the saucer. Now put it/that.... The preferred referent was the theme (cup) for it and the composite for that (cup on the saucer) with the goal (saucer) rarely chosen. Experiment 2 demonstrated that stressing it reduces the number of theme interpretations. Experiment 3 replicated the main findings from Experiment 1, regardless of whether or not the theme was the backward-looking center. The authors conclude that entities without linguistic antecedents are sometimes preferred over entities with linguistic antecedents and a single construct such as salience is insufficient to account for differences among referential forms. Candidate reference-specific constructs include the availability of conceptual composites and syntactic role. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Two experiments examined the restriction of referential domains during unscripted conversation by analyzing the modification and on-line interpretation of referring expressions. Experiment 1 demonstrated that from the earliest moments of processing, addressees interpreted referring expressions with respect to referential domains constrained by the conversation. Analysis of eye movements during the conversation showed elimination of standard competition effects seen with scripted language. Results from Experiment 2 pinpointed two pragmatic factors responsible for restriction of the referential domains used by speakers to design referential expressions and demonstrated that the same factors predict whether addressees consider local competitors to be potential referents during on-line interpretation of the same expressions. These experiments demonstrate for the first time that on-line interpretation of referring expressions in conversation is facilitated by referential domains constrained by pragmatic factors which predict when addressees are likely to encounter temporary ambiguity in language processing.},

abstract = {Seven experiments were conducted to examine the development and application of abstracted and perspective-flexible mental representations, or spatial mental models. Participants read spatial descriptions written in route and survey perspectives and undertook several memory tasks demanding the application of both declarative memories and spatial mental models. Experiment 1 manipulated reader experience by varying description exposure and found that while spatial mental models were available after only one read of a survey description, several reads were necessary to develop functionally similar spatial mental models from route descriptions; this is in contrast to declarative memories which varied only as a function of experience and not description perspective. Experiment 2 examined self-paced description reading times and found that readers tended to be slower overall while reading spatial sentences during route descriptions over the course of three read cycles, supporting Experiment 1 results; this is in contrast to non-spatial sentences which showed no differences as a function of description perspective. Experiments 3 and 4 used a dual-task methodology to examine the working memory mechanisms involved during spatial description reading, and demonstrated interactive involvement of visuospatial, articulatory, and central executive resources towards declarative memory and spatial mental model development. Experiments 5 and 6 used the same dual task methodology during retrieval of spatial mental models, and found that these models are not necessarily a collection of inferences developed during reading but rather a foundation from which to extract information towards inference generation; further, they demonstrate that both relatively coarse surface representations of the text and spatial mental models are available for retrieval. Finally, Experiment 7 examined the influence of goals and perspective preferences on spatial mental model development and found that overall those with a survey preference were better-able to develop perspective-flexible spatial mental models, while those with a route or landmark preference were better-able to learn landmark identities; goal instantiation did not show any effects. Taken together the results demonstrate that the development and application of spatial mental models are contingent upon multiple working memory systems that interact importantly with representational formats, extent of experience, and reader preferences.

In Experiments 1 and 2 participants read route and survey spatial descriptions while undertaking one of four secondary tasks targeting working memory components. Converging evidence from map drawing and statement verification tasks indicates that while articulatory mechanisms are involved in processing the language itself, visuospatial and central executive mechanisms are involved in developing spatial mental models, particularly during route description reading. In Experiments 3 and 4 participants undertook the same working memory tasks, but did so during testing; results from memory and secondary task performance converge to demonstrate that using spatial mental models is a visuospatially and centrally demanding process, particularly following route description learning.

abstract = {This book provides an in-depth view of the current issues, problems and approaches in the computation of meaning as expressed in language. Aimed at linguists, computer scientists, and logicians with an interest in the computation of meaning, this book focuses on two main topics in recent research in computational semantics. The first topic is the definition and use of underspecified semantic representations, i.e. formal structures that represent part of the meaning of a linguistic object while leaving other parts unspecified. The second topic discussed is semantic annotation. Annotated corpora have become an indispensable resource both for linguists and for developers of language and speech technology, especially when used in combination with machine learning methods. The annotation in corpora has only marginally addressed semantic information, however, since semantic annotation methodologies are still in their infancy. This book discusses the development and application of such methodologies.},

abstract = {Incremental processing offers the potential for dialogue systems to produce more natural, spontaneous conversational behaviour. This processing strategy comes at a price, though, which is that processing results may have to be revised when more input becomes available. We distinguish between two possible consequences of such revisions: a) If no observable system reaction has been produced yet, revision is just a matter of properly keeping internal state, and can be handled along the lines of the IU model of (Schlangen and Skantze, 2009). b) If however an observable reaction has been produced, revocation itself becomes a dialogue move, and as such must be handled by the dialogue manager. In this paper, we describe a dialogue manager that is capable of doing so, and provide a first discussion of how to handle such self-corrections when producing output. This dialogue manager makes a connection between utterance-level incrementality and dialogue-level incrementality by using concepts from the IU model also internally; we discuss some of the implications of this approach.},

The age of pointing onset was established to within 2 weeks. Babies were also tested at monthly intervals on a number of tasks designed to study the relation between language acquisition, fine motor skills, handedness anddetour problem solving. Acquisition of fine motor control in the pincer grip precedes pointing. Girls pointed slightly before boys and age of pointing onset (ca 1 1.3 months) predicts both the number ofgestures produced and the number ofsounds comprehended at 14.4 months. Unimanual right-handed prob- lem solving sequences predict MacArthur gestures. Both the relative balance of fine motor activity between the hands, and collaborative bimanual activity with right-hand dominance, predict speech comprehension andspeech production at 14.4 months. Detour problem solving does not predict any of the language skills measured by the MacArthur test. These results suggest that onset of pointing may be linked both to gesture and to speech through developmental changes in cerebral dominance. It is possible that there are sex differences in this process.},

abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

Visual display of the system's response not only changes human behav- ior when interacting with devices, but also creates new research areas in SDSs. On- screen item identification and resolution in utterances is one critical problem to achieve a natural and accurate human- machine communication. We pose the problem as a classification task to cor- rectly identify intended on-screen item(s) from user utterances. Using syntactic, se- mantic as well as context features from the display screen, our model can resolve dif- ferent types of referring expressions with up to 90{\%} accuracy.

We present a new probabilistic topic model for jointly identifying semantic intents and common phrases in spoken language utterances. Our model jointly learns a set of intent dependent phrases and captures semantic intent clusters as distributions over these phrases based on a distance dependent sampling method. This sampling method uses proximity of words utterances when assigning words to latent topics. We evaluate our method on labeled utterances and present several examples of discovered semantic units.

Their representations of the shared world are misaligned. In order for humans and robots to communicate with each other successfully using language, it is important for them to mediate such differences and to establish common ground. To address this issue, this paper describes a dialogue system that aims to mediate a shared perceptual basis during human-robot dialogue. In particular, we present an empirical study that examines the role of the robot's collaborative effort and the performance of natural language processing modules in dialogue grounding. Our empirical results indicate that in situated human-robot dialogue, a low collaborative effort from the robot may lead its human partner to believe a common ground is established. However, such beliefs may not reflect true mutual understanding. To support truly grounded dialogues, the robot should make an extra effort by making its partner aware of its internal representation of the shared world.},

abstract = {Memory is fleeting. New material rapidly obliterates previous material. How then can the brain deal successfully with the continual deluge of linguistic input? We argue that, to deal with this "Now-or-Never" bottleneck, the brain must compress and recode linguistic input as rapidly as possible. This observation has strong implications for the nature of language processing: (i) the language system must "eagerly" recode and compress linguistic input; (ii) as the bottleneck recurs at each new representational level, the language system must build a multi-level linguistic representation; and (iii) it must deploy all available information predictively to ensure that local linguistic ambiguities are dealt with "Right-First-Time;" once the original input is lost, there is no way for the language system to recover. This is "Chunk-and-Pass" processing. Similarly, language learning must also occur in the here-and-now. This implies that language acquisition is learning to process, rather than inducing a grammar. Moreover, this perspective provides a cognitive foundation for grammaticalization and other aspects of language change. Chunk-and-Pass processing also helps explain a variety of core properties of language, including its multi-level representational structure and duality of patterning. This approach promises to create a direct relationship between psycholinguistics and linguistic theory. More generally, we outline a framework within which to integrate often disconnected inquiries into language processing, language acquisition, and language change and evolution.},

abstract = {Abstract-Contributing to conversation, it is proposed, is accomplished in two phases. In the presentation phase, one participant ordinarily presents a stretch of speech intended to specify the content of his or her contribution. In the acceptance phase, all the participants work together to establish the mutual belief that everyone else has understood that content well enough for current purposes. The two phases together constitute a unit of conversation we call a contribution. The two phases may each have contributions embedded within them, so conversations consist of both sequential and hierarchical arrangements of contributions. As evidence for these proposals, we examine four types of contributions that occurred in directory enquiries of the telephone company. From this and other evidence, we argue that contributions appear to be a general feature of conversations.},

Before going on to the next contribution, the participants, if necessary, repair, expand on, or replace the noun phrase in an iterative process until they reach a version they mutually accept. In doing so they try to minimize their joint effort. The preferred procedure is for the speaker to present a simple noun phrase and for the addressee to accept it by allowing the next contribution to begin. We describe a communication task in which pairs of people conversed about arranging complex figures and show how the proposed model accounts for many features of the references they produced.

The central computational module is based on the mean shift iterations and finds the most probable target position in the current frame.

The theoretical analysis of the approach shows that it relates to the Bayesian framework while providing a practical, fast and efficient solution. The capability of the tracker to handle in real time partial occlusions, significant clutter, and target scale variations, is demonstrated for several image sequences},

abstract = {In visual search, detection of a target is faster when a layout of nontarget items is repeatedly encountered, suggesting that contextual invariances can guide attention. Moreover, contextual cueing can also adapt to environmental changes. For instance, when the target undergoes a predictable (i.e., learnable) location change, then contextual cueing remains effective even after the change, suggesting that a learned context is ?remapped? and adjusted to novel requirements. Here, we explored the stability of contextual remapping: Four experiments demonstrated that target location changes are only effectively remapped when both the initial and the future target positions remain predictable across the entire experiment. Otherwise, contextual remapping fails. In sum, this pattern of results suggests that multiple, predictable target locations can be associated with a given repeated context, allowing the flexible adaptation of previously learned contingencies to novel task demands.},

Methods: The group included four semantic dementia patients (SD), nine frontal variant of FTD patients (FvFTD), 15 progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients, and 11 corticobasal degeneration syndrome (CBDS) patients. Their performance was compared to a group of 10 patients with mild probable Alzheimer disease (AD) and to 10 healthy volunteers. The patients underwent a standard aphasia test and a sentence comprehension test. The experimental study included five kinds of violations: semantic coherence (SC), verb-subject agreement (VSAgr), pronominalization involving clitic movement (ClM), interrogatives (WhS) and contrastive focus constructions (CFC). Results: The FTD patients performed within normal range in the aphasia test, and in the sentence comprehension test. Within the FTD subgroups, only patients with CBDS were significantly impaired in detecting three of the five kinds of violations. AD patients were also impaired in the detection of WhS and SC anomalies and in sentence comprehension.

Discussion: The present findings indicate that, within the FTD spectrum, an impairment of syntactic knowledge can be found only in CBDS patients, even in the absence of clinical evidence of aphasia. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This book considers how people talk about the location of objects and places. Spatial language has occupied many researchers across diverse fields, such as linguistics, psychology, GIScience, architecture, and neuroscience. However, the vast majority of work in this area has examined spatial language in monologue situations, and often in highly artificial and restricted settings. Yet there is a growing recognition in the language research community that dialogue rather than monologue should be a starting point for language understanding. Hence, the current zeitgeist in both language research and robotics/AI demands an integrated examination of spatial language in dialogue settings. The present volume provides such integration for the first time and reports on the latest developments in this important field. Written in a way that will appeal to researchers across disciplines from graduate level upwards, the book sets the agenda for future research in spatial conceptualization and communication.},

abstract = {Dialogue act recognition and simulation are traditionally considered separate processes. Here, we argue that both can be fruitfully treated as interleaved processes within the same probabilistic model, leading to a synchronous improvement of performance in both. To demonstrate this, we train multiple Bayes Nets that predict the timing and content of the next user utterance. A specific focus is on providing support for barge-ins. We describe experiments using the Let's Go data that show an improvement in classification accuracy (+5{\%}) in Bayesian dialogue act recognition involving barge-ins using partial context compared to using full context. Our results also indicate that simulated dialogues with user barge-in are more realistic than simulations without barge-in events. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

The agent exhibits adaptive behaviour by learning spatiallyaware dialogue actions while the user carries out the navigation task. To this end, we use Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with relational representations to efficiently optimize dialogue actions tightly-coupled with spatial ones, and Bayesian networks to model the user's beliefs of the navigation environment. Since these beliefs are continuously changing, we induce the agent's behaviour in real time. Experimental results, using simulation, are encouraging by showing efficient adaptation to the user's navigation knowledge, specifically to the generated route and the intermediate locations to negotiate with the user.

abstract = {This article addresses the problem of scalable optimization for spatially-aware dialogue systems. These kinds of systems must perceive, reason, and act about the spatial environment where they are embedded.We formulate the problem in terms of Semi-MarkovDecision Processes and propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach to optimize subbehaviors rather than full behaviors.Because of the vast number of policies that are required to control the interaction in a dynamic environment (e.g., a dialogue system assisting a user to navigate in a building from one location to another), our learning approach is based on two stages: (a) the first stage learns low-level behavior, in advance; and (b) the second stage learns high-level behavior, in real time. For such a purpose we extend an existing algorithm in the literature of reinforcement learning in order to support reusable policies and therefore to perform fast learning. We argue that our learning approach makes the problem feasible, and we report on a novel reinforcement learning dialogue system that performs a joint optimization between dialogue and spatial behaviors.Our experiments, using simulated and real environments, are based on a text-based dialogue system for indoor navigation. Experimental results in a realistic environment reported an overall user satisfaction result of 89{\%}, which suggests that our proposed approach is attractive for its application in real interactions as it combines fast learning with adaptive and reasonable behavior.},

We present a novel approach to incremental decision making that is based on Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning to achieve an interactive optimisation of Information Presentation (IP) strategies, allowing the system to generate and comprehend backchannels and barge-ins, by employing the recent psycholinguistic hypothesis of information density (ID) (Jaeger, 2010).

@article{Dethlefs2015,
abstract = {Incremental dialogue systems are often perceived as more responsive and natural because they are able to address phenomena of turn-taking and overlapping speech, such as backchannels or barge-ins. Previous work in this area has often identified distinctive prosodic features, or features relating to syntactic or semantic completeness, as marking appropriate places of turn-taking. In a separate strand of work, psycholinguistic studies have established a connection between information density and prominence in language - the less expected a linguistic unit is in a particular context, the more likely it is to be linguistically marked. This has been observed across linguistic levels, including the prosodic, which plays an important role in predicting overlapping speech. In this article, we explore the hypothesis that information density (ID) also plays a role in turn-taking. Specifically, we aim to show that humans are sensitive to the peaks and troughs of information density in speech, and that overlapping speech at ID troughs is perceived as more acceptable than overlaps at ID peaks. To test our hypothesis, we collect human ratings for three models of generating overlapping speech based on features of: (1) prosody and semantic or syntactic completeness, (2) information density, and (3) both types of information. Results show that over 50{\%} of users preferred the version using both types of features, followed by a preference for information density features alone. This indicates a clear human sensitivity to the effects of information density in spoken language and provides a strong motivation to adopt this metric for the design, development and evaluation of turn-taking modules in spoken and incremental dialogue systems.},

These techniques open possibilities for systems to initiate responsive overlap be-haviors during user speech, such as interrupting, acknowledging, or completing a user's utterance while it is still in progress. In an implemented system, we show that relatively high accuracy can be achieved in understanding of spontaneous utterances before utterances are completed. Further, we present a method for determining when a system has reached a point of maximal understanding of an ongoing user utterance, and show that this determination can be made with high precision. Finally, we discuss a prototype implementation that shows how systems can use these abilities to strategically initiate system completions of user utterances.

abstract = {The main goal of this paper is to explore the predictive power of dialogue context on Dialogue Act classification, both as concerns the linear context provided by previous dialogue acts, and the hierarchical context specified by conversational games. As our learning approach, we extend Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) as Feature LSA (FLSA), and combine FLSA with the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. FLSA adds richer linguistic features to LSA, which only uses words. The k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm obtains its best results when applied to the reduced semantic spaces generated by FLSA. Empirically, our results are better than previously published results on two different corpora, MapTask and CallHome Spanish. Linguistically, we confirm and extend previous observations that the hierarchical dialogue structure encoded via the notion of game is of primary importance for dialogue act recognition.},

The aim of the present work is to provide a humanoid robot with cognitive, perceptual and motor skills fundamental for the acquisition of a rudimentary form of language. We present a novel probabilistic model, inspired by the findings in cognitive sciences, able to associate spoken words with their perceptually grounded meanings. The main focus is set on acquiring the meaning of various perceptual categories (e.g. red, blue, circle, above, etc.), rather than specific world entities (e.g. an apple, a toy, etc.). Our probabilistic model is based on a variant of multi-instance learning technique, and it enables a robotic platform to learn grounded meanings of adjective/noun terms. The systems could be used to understand and generate appropriate natural language descriptions of real objects in a scene, and it has been successfully tested on the NAO humanoid robotic platform.},

abstract = {When listeners follow spoken instructions to manipulate real objects, their eye movements to the objects are closely time locked to the referring words. We review five experiments showing that this time-locked characteristic of eye movements provides a detailed profile of the processes that underlie real-time spoken language comprehension. Together, the first four experiments showed that listeners immediately integrated lexical, sublexical, and prosodic information in the spoken input with information from the visual context to reduce the set of referents to the intended one. The fifth experiment demonstrated that a visual referential context affected the initial structuring of the linguistic input, eliminating even strong syntactic preferences that result in clear garden paths when the referential context is introduced linguistically. We argue that context affected the earliest moments of language processing because it was highly accessible and relevant to the behavioral goals of the listener.},

abstract = {This paper presents an overview of methods that can be used to collect and analyse data on user responses to spoken dialogue system components intended to increase human-likeness, and to evaluate how well the components succeed in reaching that goal. Wizard-of-Oz variations, human-human data manipulation, and micro-domains are discussed in this context, as is the use of third-party reviewers to get a measure of the degree of human-likeness. We also present the two-way mimicry target, a model for measuring how well a human-computer dialogue mimics or replicates some aspect of human-human dialogue, including human flaws and inconsistencies. Although we have added a measure of innovation, none of the techniques is new in its entirety. Taken together and described from a human-likeness perspective, however, they form a set of tools that may widen the path towards human-like spoken dialogue systems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Dialogue acts model the intent underlying dialogue moves. In natural language tutorial dialogue, student dialogue moves hold important information about knowledge and goals, and are therefore an integral part of providing adaptive tutoring. Automatically classifying these dialogue acts is a challenging task, traditionally addressed with supervised classification techniques requiring substantial manual time and effort. There is growing interest in unsupervised dialogue act classification to address this limitation. This paper presents a novel unsupervised framework, query-likelihood clustering, for classifying student dialogue acts. This framework combines automated natural language processing with clustering and a novel adaptation of an information retrieval technique. Evaluation against manually labeled dialogue acts on a tutorial dialogue corpus in the domain of introductory computer science demonstrates that the proposed technique outperforms existing approaches. The results indicate that this technique holds promise for automatically understanding corpora of tutorial dialogue and for building adaptive dialogue systems.},

However, some dialogues, such as task-oriented dialogues with parallel task streams, hold rich information that has not yet been leveraged within unsupervised dialogue act models. This paper investigates incorporating task features into an unsupervised dialogue act model trained on a corpus of human tutoring in introductory computer science. Experimental results show that incorporating task features and dialogue history features significantly improve unsupervised dialogue act classification, particularly within a hierarchical framework that gives prominence to dialogue history. This work constitutes a step toward building high-performing unsupervised dialogue act models that will be used in the next generation of task-oriented dialogue systems.},

abstract = {Generating referring expressions is a task that has received a great deal of attention in the natural-language generation community, with an increasing amount of recent effort targeted at the generation of multimodal referring expressions. However, most implemented systems tend to assume very little shared knowledge between the speaker and the hearer, and therefore must generate fully-elaborated linguistic references. Some systems do include a representation of the physical context or the dialogue context; however, other sources of contextual information are not normally used. Also, the generated references normally consist only of language and, possibly, deictic pointing gestures. When referring to objects in the context of a task-based interaction involving jointly manipulating objects, a much richer notion of context is available, which permits a wider range of referring options. In particular, when conversational partners cooperate on a mutual task in a shared environment, objects can be made accessible simply by manipulating them as part of the task. We demonstrate that such expressions are common in a corpus of human-human dialogues based on constructing virtual objects, and then describe how this type of reference can be incorporated into the output of a humanoid robot that engages in similar joint construction dialogues with a human partner.},

This limitation is in part due to the increasing difficulty of acquiring sufficient training data in the form of labeled images as the number of object categories grows. One remedy is to leverage data from other sources – such as text data – both to train visual models and to constrain their pre- dictions. In this paper we present a new deep visual-semantic embedding model trained to identify visual objects using both labeled image data as well as seman- tic information gleaned from unannotated text. We demonstrate that this model matches state-of-the-art performance on the 1000-class ImageNet object recogni- tion challenge while making more semantically reasonable errors, and also show that the semantic information can be exploited to make predictions about tens of thousands of image labels not observed during training. Semantic knowledge improves such zero-shot predictions achieving hit rates of up to 18{\%} across thou- sands of novel labels never seen by the visual model.},

abstract = {The success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on data representation, and we hypothesize that this is because different representations can entangle and hide more or less the different explanatory factors of variation behind the data. Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and joint training of deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, auto-encoders, manifold learning, and deep architectures. This motivates longer-term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation and manifold learning.},

We compared the resulting dialogs with dialogs produced over the previous month without IDP. Results show that the incremental strategy significantly improved system performance by eliminating long and often off-task utterances that generally produce poor speech recognition results. User behavior is also affected; the user tends to shorten utterances after being interrupted by the system.},

abstract = {The fine structure of conversational interaction is of significant interest for wide swathes of the behavioural sciences: linguists, philosophers, psychologists, sociologists, literary scholars, artificial intelligence researchers must all contend with issues relating to the nature of meaning and its sharing among interlocuters, the possibility of repair — the wide range of corrective actions that occur when ‘trouble' arises in interaction — and the characterization of coherence in interaction. This book presents the results of attempting to create a precise, grammatically rooted, theory of conversation motivated by data from real conversations. It develops KoS, one of the most detailed theories of context in conversation, and uses this to analyze a variety of linguistic constructions characteristic of spoken interaction, many of which have not been previously analyzed formally. KoS has descriptive reach from the micro-conversational (e.g., self-repair at the word level) to macro-level phenomena such as multi-party conversation and the characterization of distinct conversational genres. It draws on extensive corpus studies of the British National Corpus, on evidence from language acquisition, and on computer simulations of language evolution. KoS provides accounts of the opening, middle game, and closing stages of conversation. KoS also offers a new perspective on traditional semantic concerns such as quantification and anaphora. It suggests a new methodological criterion — stronger than traditional compositionality — regulating allowable semantic denotations. All in all, KoS provides a highly detailed theory of relevance, taking in the illocutionary, metacommunicative, metadiscursive, and genre-based components of this complex notion. This book challenges orthodox views of grammar by arguing that grammar and interaction are intrinsically bound. It argues that, unless we wish to exclude from analysis a large body of frequently occurring words and constructions, the right way to construe grammar is as a system that characterizes types of talk in interaction.},

To resolve semantic ambiguities we propose a situation model that captures as- pects of the physical context of an utterance as well as the speaker's intentions, in our case represented by recognized plans. In a single, coherent Framework for Understanding Situated Speech (FUSS) we show how these two influences, acting on an ambiguous representation of the speech signal, complement each other to disambiguate form and content of situated speech. This method produces promising results in a game playing environment and leaves room for other types of situation models.},

abstract = {Speech and natural language are natural and convenient ways to interact with artificial characters. Current use of language in games, however, is limited to menu systems and inter- player communication. To achieve smooth linguistic commu- nication with synthetic agents, research should focus on how language connects to the situation in which it occurs. Taking account of the physical scene (where is the speaker located, what is around her, when does she speak?) as well as the func- tional aspects of the situation (why did he choose to speak? What are his likely plans?) can disambiguate the linguistic signal in form and content. We present a game environment to collect time synchronized speech and action streams, to visualize these data and to annotate them at different stages of processing. We further sketch a framework for situated speech understanding on such data, taking into account as- pects of the physical situation as well as the plans players follow. Our results show that this combination of influences achieves remarkable improvements over the individual situ- ation models despite the very noisy and spontaneous nature of the speech involved. This work provides a basis for devel- oping characters that use situated natural spoken language to communicate meaningfully with human players. Introduction},

abstract = {Active learning can be used for the maintenance of a deployed spoken dialog system (SDS) that evolves with time and when large collection of dialog traces can be collected on a daily basis. At the spoken language understanding (SLU) level this maintenance process is crucial as a deployed SDS evolves quickly when services are added, modified or dropped. Knowledge-based approaches, based on manually written grammars or inference rules, are often preferred as system designers can modify directly the SLU models in order to take into account such a modification in the service, even if no or very little related data has been collected. However as new examples are added to the annotated corpus, corpus-based methods can then be applied, replacing or in addition to the initial knowledge-based models. This paper describes an active learning scheme, based on an SLU criterion, which is used for automatically updating the SLU models of a deployed SDS. Two kind of SLU models are going to be compared: rule-based ones, used in the deployed system and consisting of several thousands of hand-crafted rules; corpus-based ones, based on the automatic learning of classifiers on an annotated corpus.},

abstract = {As interactive voice response systems become more prevalent and provide increasingly more complex functionality, it becomes clear that the challenges facing such systems are not solely in their synthesis and recognition capabilities. Issues such as the coordination of turn exchanges between system and user also play an important role in system usability. In particular, both systems and users have difficulty determining when the other is taking or relinquishing the turn. In this paper, we seek to identify turn-taking cues correlated with human-human turn exchanges which are automatically computable. We compare the presence of potential prosodic, acoustic, and lexico-syntactic turn-yielding cues in prosodic phrases preceding turn changes (smooth switches) vs. turn retentions (holds) vs. backchannels in the Columbia Games Corpus, a large corpus of task-oriented dialogues, to determine which features reliably distinguish between these three. We identify seven turn-yielding cues, all of which can be extracted automatically, for future use in turn generation and recognition in interactive voice response (IVR) systems. Testing Duncan's (1972) hypothesis that these turn-yielding cues are linearly correlated with the occurrence of turn-taking attempts, we further demonstrate that, the greater the number of turn-yielding cues that are present, the greater the likelihood that a turn change will occur. We also identify six cues that precede backchannels, which will also be useful for IVR backchannel generation and recognition; these cues correlate with backchannel occurrence in a quadratic manner. We find similar results for overlapping and for non-overlapping speech. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Coecke, Sadrzadeh, and Clark (arXiv:1003.4394v1 [cs.CL]) developed a compositional model of meaning for distributional semantics, in which each word in a sentence has a meaning vector and the distributional meaning of the sentence is a function of the tensor products of the word vectors. Abstractly speaking, this function is the morphism corresponding to the grammatical structure of the sentence in the category of finite dimensional vector spaces. In this paper, we provide a concrete method for implementing this linear meaning map, by constructing a corpus-based vector space for the type of sentence. Our construction method is based on structured vector spaces whereby meaning vectors of all sentences, regardless of their grammatical structure, live in the same vector space. Our proposed sentence space is the tensor product of two noun spaces, in which the basis vectors are pairs of words each augmented with a grammatical role. This enables us to compare meanings of sentences by simply taking the inner product of their vectors.},

abstract = {To study the time course of sentence formulation, we monitored the eye movements of speakers as they described simple events. The similarity between speakers' initial eye movements and those of observers performing a nonverbal event-comprehension task suggested that response-relevant information was rapidly extracted from scenes, allowing speakers to select grammatical subjects based on comprehended events rather than salience. When speaking extemporaneously, speakers began fixating pictured elements less than a second before naming them within their descriptions, a finding consistent with incremental lexical encoding. Eye movements anticipated the order of mention despite changes in picture orientation, in who-did-what-to-whom, and in sentence structure. The results support Wundt's theory of sentence production.},

abstract = {Spoken language understanding (SLU) aims at extracting meaning from natural language speech. Over the past decade, a variety of practical goal-oriented spoken dialog systems have been built for limited domains. SLU in these systems ranges from understanding predetermined phrases through fixed grammars, extracting some predefined named entities, extracting users' intents for call classification, to combinations of users' intents and named entities. In this paper, we present the SLU system of VoiceTone{\&}reg; (a service provided by AT{\&}T where AT{\&}T develops, deploys and hosts spoken dialog applications for enterprise customers). The SLU system includes extracting both intents and the named entities from the users' utterances. For intent determination, we use statistical classifiers trained from labeled data, and for named entity extraction we use rule-based fixed grammars. The focus of our work is to exploit data and to use machine learning techniques to create scalable SLU systems which can be quickly deployed for new domains with minimal human intervention. These objectives are achieved by 1) using the predicate-argument representation of semantic content of an utterance; 2) extending statistical classifiers to seamlessly integrate hand crafted classification rules with the rules learned from data; and 3) developing an active learning framework to minimize the human labeling effort for quickly building the classifier models and adapting them to changes. We present an evaluation of this system using two deployed applications of VoiceTone{\&}reg;.},

abstract = {This third volume of the monumental commentary on Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations covers sections 243-427, which constitute the heart of the book. Like the previous volumes, it consists of philosophical essays and exegesis. The thirteen essays cover all the major themes of this part of Wittgenstein's masterpiece: the private language arguments, privacy, avowals and descriptions, private ostensive definition, criteria, minds and machines, behavior and behaviorism, the self, the inner and the outer, thinking, consciounesss, and the imagination. The exegesis clarifies and evaluates Wittgenstein's arguments, drawing extensively on all the unpublished papers, examining the evolution of his ideas in manuscript sources and definitively settling many controversies about the interpretation of the published text.  This commentary, like its predecessors, is indispensable for the study of Wittgenstein and is essential reading for students of the philosophy of mind.  A fourth and final volume, entitled Wittgenstein: Mind and Will will complete the commentary.},

abstract = {One of the first steps in building a spoken language understanding (SLU) module for dialogue systems is the extraction of flat concepts out of a given word sequence, usually provided by an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. In this paper, six different modeling approaches are investigated to tackle the task of concept tagging. These methods include classical, well-known generative and discriminative methods like Finite State Transducers (FSTs), Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMMs), or Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as well as techniques recently applied to natural language processing such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) or Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs). Following a detailed description of the models, experimental and comparative results are presented on three corpora in different languages and with different complexity. The French MEDIA corpus has already been exploited during an evaluation campaign and so a direct comparison with existing benchmarks is possible. Recently collected Italian and Polish corpora are used to test the robustness and portability of the modeling approaches. For all tasks, manual transcriptions as well as ASR inputs are considered. Additionally to single systems, methods for system combination are investigated. The best performing model on all tasks is based on conditional random fields. On the MEDIA evaluation corpus, a concept error rate of 12.6{\%} could be achieved. Here, additionally to attribute names, attribute values have been extracted using a combination of a rule-based and a statistical approach. Applying system combination using weighted ROVER with all six systems, the concept error rate (CER) drops to 12.0{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

This paper focuses on eye gaze and its combination with speech. We develop a model that resolves references to visual (screen) elements in a conversational web browsing system. The system detects eye gaze, recognizes speech, and then interprets the user's browsing intent (e.g., click on a specific element) through a combination of spoken language understanding and eye gaze tracking. We experiment with multi-turn interactions collected in a wizard-of-Oz scenario where users are asked to perform several web-browsing tasks. We compare several gaze features and evaluate their effectiveness when combined with speech-based lexical features. The resulting multi-modal system not only increases user intent (turn) accuracy by 17{\{}{\%}{\}}, but also resolves the referring expression ambiguity commonly observed in dialog systems with a 10{\{}{\%}{\}} increase in F-measure.},

@article{harnard:grounding,
abstract = {There has been much discussion recently about the scope and limits of purely symbolic models of the mind and about the proper role of connectionism in cognitive modeling. This paper describes the "symbol grounding problem": How can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made intrinsic to the system, rather than just parasitic on the meanings in our heads? How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated solely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but other meaningless symbols? The problem is analogous to trying to learn Chinese from a Chinese/Chinese dictionary alone. A candidate solution is sketched: Symbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic representations of two kinds: (1) iconic representations, which are analogs of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2) categorical representations, which are learned and innate feature detectors that pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their sensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event categories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical representations. Higher-order (3) symbolic representations, grounded in these elementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category membership relations (e.g. "An X is a Y that is Z"). Connectionism is one natural candidate for the mechanism that learns the invariant features underlying categorical representations, thereby connecting names to the proximal projections of the distal objects they stand for. In this way connectionism can be seen as a complementary component in a hybrid nonsymbolic/symbolic model of the mind, rather than a rival to purely symbolic modeling. Such a hybrid model would not have an autonomous symbolic "module," however; the symbolic functions would emerge as an intrinsically "dedicated" symbol system as a consequence of the bottom-up grounding of categories' names in their sensory representations. Symbol manipulation would be governed not just by the arbitrary shapes of the symbol tokens, but by the nonarbitrary shapes of the icons and category invariants in which they are grounded. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

@article{Barnard2003,
abstract = {We present a new approach for modeling multi-modal data sets, focusing on the specific case of segmented images with associated text. Learning the joint distribution of image regions and words has many applications. We consider in detail predicting words associated with whole images (auto-annotation) and corresponding to particular image regions (region naming). Auto-annotation might help organize and access large collections of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition as a process of translating image regions to words, much as one might translate from one language to another. Learning the relationships between image regions and semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data mining, particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining techniques to collections of images. We develop a number of models for the joint distribution of image regions and words, including several which explicitly learn the correspondence between regions and words. We study multi-modal and correspondence extensions to Hofmann's hierarchical clustering/aspect model, a translation model adapted from statistical machine translation (Brown et al.), and a multi-modal extension to mixture of latent Dirichlet allocation (MoM-LDA). All models are assessed using a large collection of annotated images of real scenes. We study in depth the difficult problem of measuring performance. For the annotation task, we look at prediction performance on held out data. We present three alternative measures, oriented toward different types of task. Measuring the performance of correspondence methods is harder, because one must determine whether a word has been placed on the right region of an image. We can use annotation performance as a proxy measure, but accurate measurement requires hand labeled data, and thus must occur on a smaller scale. We show results using both an annotation proxy, and manually labeled data.},

abstract = {As user demand scales for intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) such as Apple's Siri, Google's Google Now, and Microsoft's Cortana, we are approaching the computational limits of current datacenter architectures. It is an open ques- tion how future server architectures should evolve to enable this emerging class of applications, and the lack of an open- source IPA workload is an obstacle in addressing this ques- tion. In this paper, we present the design of Sirius, an open end-to-end IPA web-service application that accepts queries in the form of voice and images, and responds with natu- ral language. We then use this workload to investigate the implications of four points in the design space of future accelerator-based server architectures spanning traditional CPUs, GPUs, manycore throughput co-processors, and FP- GAs. To investigate future server designs for Sirius, we de- compose Sirius into a suite of 7 benchmarks (Sirius Suite) comprising the computationally intensive bottlenecks of Sir- ius. We port Sirius Suite to a spectrum of accelerator plat- forms and use the performance and power trade-offs across these platforms to perform a total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis of various server design points. In our study, we find that accelerators are critical for the future scalability of IPA services. Our results show that GPU- and FPGA- accelerated servers improve the query latency on average by 10× and 16×. For a given throughput, GPU- and FPGA- accelerated servers can reduce the TCO of datacenters by 2.6× and 1.4×, respectively. Permission},

abstract = {This paper discusses semantic processing using the Hidden Vector State (HVS) model. The HVS model extends the basic discrete Markov model by encoding context in each state as a vector. State transitions are then factored into a stack shift operation similar to those of a push-down automaton followed by a push of a new preterminal semantic category label. The key feature of the model is that it can capture hierarchical structure without the use of treebank data for training. Experiments have been conducted in the travel domain using the relatively simple ATIS corpus and the more complex DARPA Communicator Task. The results show that the HVS model can be robustly trained from only minimally annotated corpus data. Furthermore, when measured by its ability to extract attribute-value pairs from natural language queries in the travel domain, the HVS model outperforms a conventional finite-state semantic tagger by 4.1{\%} in F-measure for ATIS and by 6.6{\%} in F-measure for Communicator, suggesting that the benefit of the HVS model's ability to encode context increases as the task becomes more complex. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper presents a computational model of how conversational participants collaborate in order to make a referring action successful. The model is based on the view of language as goal-directed behavior. We propose that the content of a referring expression can be accounted for by the planning paradigm. Not only does this approach allow the processes of building referring expressions and identifying their referents to be captured by plan construction and plan inference, it also allows us to account for how participants clarify a referring expression by using meta-actions that reason about and manipulate the plan derivation that corresponds to the referring expression. To account for how clarification goals arise and how inferred clarification plans affect the agent, we propose that the agents are in a certain state of mind, and that this state includes an intention to achieve the goal of referring and a plan that the agents are currently considering. It is this mental state that sanctions the adoption of goals and the acceptance of inferred plans, and so acts as a link between understanding and generation.},

We compare two types of statistical models for this task: a) local models, which predict a single class for an input; and b), sequential models, which align a sequence of classes to a sequence of input tokens. We show that, with some modifications, the first type of model can be improved and made to approximate the output of the second, even though the lat- ter is more informative. We show on two different data sets that both types of model achieve comparable performance (signifi- cantly better than a baseline), with the first type requiring simpler training data. Re- sults for the first type of model have been reported in the literature; we show that for our kind of data our more sophisticated variant of the model performs better.},

These systems are expensive to develop and they suffer from significant degradation in performance when faced with recognition errors. This paper presents a robust method for SLU based on features extracted from the full posterior distribution of recognition hypotheses encoded in the form of word confusion networks. Following [1], the system uses SVM classifiers operating on n-gram features, trained on unaligned input/output pairs. Performance is evaluated on both an off-line corpus and on-line in a live user trial. It is shown that a statistical discriminative approach to SLU operating on the full posterior ASR output distribution can substantially improve performance both in terms of accuracy and overall dialogue reward. Furthermore, additional gains can be obtained by incorporating features from the previous system output.},

abstract = {Discourse structures have a central role in several computational tasks, such as question-answering or dialogue generation. In particular, the framework of the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) offers a sound formalism for hierarchical text organization. In this article, we present HILDA, an implemented discourse parser based on RST and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. SVM classifiers are trained and applied to discourse segmentation and relation labeling. By combining labeling with a greedy bottom-up tree building approach, we are able to create accurate discourse trees in linear time complexity. Importantly, our parser can parse entire texts, whereas the publicly available parser SPADE (Soricut and Marcu 2003) is limited to sentence level analysis. HILDA outperforms other discourse parsers for tree structure construction and discourse relation labeling. For the discourse parsing task, our system reaches 78.3{\%} of the performance level of human annotators. Compared to a state-of-the-art rule-based discourse parser, our system achieves an performance increase of 11.6{\%}.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The performance costs associated with cell phone use while driving were assessed meta-analytically using standardized measures of effect size along five dimensions. BACKGROUND: There have been many studies on the impact of cell phone use on driving, showing some mixed findings. METHODS: Twenty-three studies (contributing 47 analysis entries) met the appropriate conditions for the meta-analysis. The statistical results from each of these studies were converted into effect sizes and combined in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Overall, there were clear costs to driving performance when drivers were engaged in cell phone conversations. However, subsequent analyses indicated that these costs were borne primarily by reaction time tasks, with far smaller costs associated with tracking (lane-keeping) performance. Hands-free and handheld phones revealed similar patterns of results for both measures of performance. Conversation tasks tended to show greater costs than did information-processing tasks (e.g., word games). There was a similar pattern of results for passenger and remote (cell phone) conversations. Finally, there were some small differences between simulator and field studies, though both exhibited costs in performance for cell phone use. CONCLUSION: We suggest that (a) there are significant costs to driver reactions to external hazards or events associated with cell phone use, (b) hands-free cell phones do not eliminate or substantially reduce these costs, and (c) different research methodologies or performance measures may underestimate these costs. APPLICATION: Potential applications of this research include the assessment of performance costs attributable to different types of cell phones, cell phone conversations, experimental measures, or methodologies.},

abstract = {Spoken contributions in dialogue often continue or complete earlier contributions by either the same or a different speaker. These compound contributions (CCs) thus provide a natural context for investigations of incremental processing in dialogue. We present a corpus study which confirms that CCs are a key dialogue phenomenon: almost 20{\%} of contributions fit our general definition of CCs, with nearly 3{\%} being the cross-person case most often studied. The results suggest that processing is word-by-word incremental, as splits can occur within syntactic ‘constituents'; however, some systematic differences between sameand cross-person cases indicate important dialogue-specific pragmatic effects. An experimental study then investigates these effects by artificially introducing CCs into multi-party text dialogue. Results suggest that CCs affect people's expectations about who will speak next and whether other participants have formed a coalition or ‘party'. Together, these studies suggest that CCs require an incremental processing mechanism that can provide a resource for constructing linguistic constituents that span multiple contributions and multiple participants. They also suggest the need to model higher-level dialogue units that have consequences for the organisation of turn-taking and for the development of a shared context.},

abstract = {In order to communicate with their users in a natural and effective manner, humanlike robots must seamlessly integrate behaviors across multiple modalities, including speech, gaze, and gestures. While researchers and designers have successfully drawn on studies of human interactions to build models of humanlike behavior and to achieve such integration in robot behavior, the development of such models involves a laborious process of inspecting data to identify patterns within each modality or across modalities of behavior and to represent these patterns as "rules" or heuristics that can be used to control the behaviors of a robot, but provides little support for validation, extensibility, and learning. In this paper, we explore how a learning-based approach to modeling multimodal behaviors might address these limitations. We demonstrate the use of a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) for modeling how humans coordinate speech, gaze, and gesture behaviors in narration and for achieving such coordination with robots. The evaluation of this approach in a human-robot interaction study shows that this learning-based approach is comparable to conventional modeling approaches in enabling effective robot behaviors while reducing the effort involved in identifying behavioral patterns and providing a probabilistic representation of the dynamics of human behavior.

Methods: The scientific literature exploring the effects of these two types of cell phone use on driving and driving-related performance is reviewed here. Results: Our review shows that talking on the phone, regardless of phone type, has negative impacts on performance especially in detecting and identifying events. Performance while using a hands-free phone was rarely found to be better than when using a handheld phone. Some studies found that drivers compensate for the deleterious effects of cell phone use when using a handheld phone but neglect to do so when using a hands-free phone.

abstract = {In development, children often use gesture to communicate before they use words. The question is whether these gestures merely precede language development or are fundamentally tied to it. We examined 10 children making the transition from single words to two-word combinations and found that gesture had a tight relation to the children's lexical and syntactic development. First, a great many of the lexical items that each child produced initially in gesture later moved to that child's verbal lexicon. Second, children who were first to produce gesture-plus-word combinations conveying two elements in a proposition (point at bird and say "nap") were also first to produce two-word combinations ("bird nap"). Changes in gesture thus not only predate but also predict changes in language, suggesting that early gesture may be paving the way for future developments in language.},

In this paper, we present the architecture and features of our latest system, extended from an earlier version which was built and evaluated with real users (Janarthanam et al., 2013). The new features include navigation based on visible landmarks, navigation adapted to the user's previous route knowledge, and tourist information pushing based on visible and proximal points-of-interest. The system also uses social media to infer “popularity” of geographical entities.},

@article{Jaywant2012,
abstract = {Everyday communication involves processing nonverbal emotional cues from auditory and visual stimuli. To characterize whether emotional meanings are processed with category-specificity from speech prosody and facial expressions, we employed a cross-modal priming task (the Facial Affect Decision Task; Pell, 2005a) using emotional stimuli with the same valence but that differed by emotion category. After listening to angry, sad, disgusted, or neutral vocal primes, subjects rendered a facial affect decision about an emotionally congruent or incongruent face target. Our results revealed that participants made fewer errors when judging face targets that conveyed the same emotion as the vocal prime, and responded significantly faster for most emotions (anger and sadness). Surprisingly, participants responded slower when the prime and target both conveyed disgust, perhaps due to attention biases for disgust-related stimuli. Our findings suggest that vocal emotional expressions with similar valence are processed with category specificity, and that discrete emotion knowledge implicitly affects the processing of emotional faces between sensory modalities. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper presents an approach to automatically optimizing the retrieval quality of search engines using clickthrough data. Intuitively, a good information retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking, with less relevant documents following below. While previous approaches to learning retrieval functions from examples exist, they typically require training data generated from relevance judgments by experts. This makes them difficult and expensive to apply. The goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for training, namely the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking. Such clickthrough data is available in abundance and can be recorded at very low cost. Taking a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions. From a theoretical perspective, this method is shown to be well-founded in a risk minimization framework. Furthermore, it is shown to be feasible even for large sets of queries and features. The theoretical results are verified in a controlled experiment. It shows that the method can effectively adapt the retrieval function of a meta-search engine to a particular group of users, outperforming Google in terms of retrieval quality after only a couple of hundred training examples.},

Three types of user knowledge, i.e., cooperative, corrective and self-directing, are designed and integrated to generate behaviors of corresponding user-types. In experiments to investigate the patterns of simulated users, the approach successfully generated cooperative, corrective and self-directing user intention patterns. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The fundamental claim of this paper is that salience - both visual and linguistic - is an important overarching semantic category structuring visually situated discourse. Based on this we argue that computer systems attempting to model the evolving context of a visually situated discourse should integrate models of visual and linguistic salience within their natural language processing (NLP) framework. The paper highlights the importance of dynamically updating and interrelating visual and linguistic discourse context representations. To support our approach, we have developed a real-time, natural language virtual reality (NLVR) system (called LIVE, for Linguistic Interaction with Virtual Environments) that implements an NLP framework based on both visual and linguistic salience. Within this framework saliency information underpins two of the core subtasks of NLP: reference resolution and the generation of referring expressions. We describe the theoretical basis and architecture of the LIVE NLP framework and present extensive evaluation results comparing the system's performance with that of human participants in a number of experiments. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The model is introduced both informally and formally, and is applied to a range of languages. Alongside formal definitions, the authors use step-by-step derivations and detailed lexical definitions to illustrate this new form of syntactic analysis and to show how the model can be applied to a broad range of languages. In this way, the reader gets a sense of the rich potential the framework provides for general application to linguistic analysis. In bringing together explanations of knowledge of language, and the way language is used in parsing, the book challenges basic assumptions of linguistic theory, and is an essential read for anyone interested in what it means to know a language.},

@phdthesis{1,
abstract = {The primary concern of this thesis is to model the resolution of spoken referring expressions made in order to identify objects; in particular, everyday objects that can be perceived visually and distinctly from other objects. The practical goal of such a model is for it to be implemented as a component for use in a live, interactive, autonomous spoken dialogue system. The requirement of interaction imposes an added complication; one that has been ignored in previous models and approaches to automatic reference resolution: the model must attempt to resolve the reference incrementally as it unfolds–not wait until the end of the referring expression to begin the resolution process. Beyond components in dialogue systems, reference has been a major player in the philosophy of meaning for longer than a century. For example, Gottlob Frege (1892) has distinguished between Sinn (sense) and Bedeutung (reference), discussed how they are related and how they relate to the meaning of words and expressions. It has furthermore been argued (e.g., Dahlgren (1976)) that reference to entities in the actual world is not just a fundamental notion of semantic theory, but the fundamental notion; for an individual acquiring a language, understanding the meaning of many words and concepts is done via the task of reference, beginning in early childhood. In this thesis, we pursue an account of word meaning that is based on perception of objects; for example, the meaning of the word red is based on visual features that are selected as distinguishing red objects from non-red ones. This thesis proposes two statistical models of incremental reference resolution. Given ex- amples of referring expressions and visual aspects of the objects to which those expressions referred, both model components learn a functional mapping between the words of the refer- ring expressions and the visual aspects. A generative model, the simple incremental update model, presented in Chapter 5, uses a mediating variable to learn the mapping, whereas a dis- criminative model, the words-as-classifiers model, presented in Chapter 6, learns the mapping directly and improves over the generative model. Both models have been evaluated in various reference resolution tasks to objects in virtual scenes as well as real, tangible objects. This thesis shows that both models work robustly and are able to resolve referring expressions made in reference to visually present objects despite realistic, noisy conditions of speech and object recognition. A theoretical and practical comparison is also provided. Special emphasis is given to the discriminative model in this thesis because of its simplicity and ability to represent word meanings. It is in the learning and application of this model that gives credence to the above claim that reference is the fundamental notion for semantic theory and that meanings of (visual) words is done through experiencing referring expressions made to objects that are visually perceivable.},

abstract = {Statistical spoken dialogue systems based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) have been shown to be more robust to speech recognition errors by maintaining a belief distribution over multiple dialogue states and making policy decisions based on the entire distribution rather than the single most likely hypothesis. To date most POMDP-based systems have used generative trackers. However, concerns about modelling accuracy have created interest in discriminative methods, and recent results from the second Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC2) have shown that discriminative trackers can significantly outperform generative models in terms of tracking accuracy. The aim of this paper is to investigate the extent to which these improvements translate into improved task completion rates when incorporated into a spoken dialogue system. To do this, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) tracker described by Henderson et al in DSTC2 was integrated into the Cambridge statistical dialogue system and compared with the existing generative Bayesian network tracker. Using a Gaussian Process (GP) based policy, the experimental results indicate that the system using the RNN tracker performs significantly better than the system with the original Bayesian network tracker.},

abstract = {Behavior and experience are organized around the enjoyment and pursuit of incentives. During the time that an incentive is behaviorally salient, an organism is especially responsive to incentive-related cues. This sustained sensitivity requires postulating a continuing state (denoted by a construct, current concern) with a definite onset (commitment) and offset (consummation or disengagement). Disengagement follows frustration, accompanies the behavioral process of extinction, and involves an incentive-disengagement cycle of invigoration, aggression, depression, and recovery. Depression is thus a normal part of disengagement that may be either adaptive or maladaptive for the individual but is probably adaptive for the species. The theory offers implications for motivation; etiology, symptomatology, and treatment of depression; drug use; and other social problem areas.},

abstract = {Inspired by recent advances in multimodal learning and machine translation, we introduce an encoder-decoder pipeline that learns (a): a multimodal joint embedding space with images and text and (b): a novel language model for decoding distributed representations from our space. Our pipeline effectively unifies joint image-text embedding models with multimodal neural language models. We introduce the structure-content neural language model that disentangles the structure of a sentence to its content, conditioned on representations produced by the encoder. The encoder allows one to rank images and sentences while the decoder can generate novel descriptions from scratch. Using LSTM to encode sentences, we match the state-of-the-art performance on Flickr8K and Flickr30K without using object detections. We also set new best results when using the 19-layer Oxford convolutional network. Furthermore we show that with linear encoders, the learned embedding space captures multimodal regularities in terms of vector space arithmetic e.g. *image of a blue car* - "blue" + "red" is near images of red cars. Sample captions generated for 800 images are made available for comparison.},

abstract = {Studies monitoring eye-movements in scenes containing entities have provided robust evidence for incremental reference resolution processes. This paper addresses the less studied question of whether depicted event scenes can affect processes of incremental thematic role-assignment. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants inspected agent-action-patient events while listening to German verb-second sentences with initial structural and role ambiguity. The experiments investigated the time course with which listeners could resolve this ambiguity by relating the verb to the depicted events. Such verb-mediated visual event information allowed early disambiguation on-line, as evidenced by anticipatory eye-movements to the appropriate agent/patient role filler. We replicated this finding while investigating the effects of intonation. Experiment 3 demonstrated that when the verb was sentence-final and thus did not establish early reference to the depicted events, linguistic cues alone enabled disambiguation before people encountered the verb. Our results reveal the on-line influence of depicted events on incremental thematic role-assignment and disambiguation of local structural and role ambiguity. In consequence, our findings require a notion of reference that includes actions and events in addition to entities (e.g. Semantics and Cognition, 1983), and argue for a theory of on-line sentence comprehension that exploits a rich inventory of semantic categories. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We developed and tested a “situationally-aware” dialogue system that can interrupt its speech when a situation which requires more attention from the driver is detected, and can resume when driving conditions return to normal. Furthermore, our system allows driver-controlled resumption of in- terrupted speech via verbal or visual cues (head nods). Over two experiments, we found that the situationally-aware spoken dialogue system improves driving performance and attention to the speech content, while driver-controlled speech resumption does not hinder performance in either of these two tasks.},

abstract = {This paper introduces Logical Semantics with Perception (LSP), a model for grounded lan- guage acquisition that learns to map natu- ral language statements to their referents in a physical environment. For example, given an image, LSP can map the statement “blue mug on the table” to the set of image seg- ments showing blue mugs on tables. LSP learns physical representations for both cate- gorical (“blue,” “mug”) and relational (“on”) language, and also learns to compose these representations to produce the referents of en- tire statements. We further introduce a weakly supervised training procedure that estimates LSP's parameters using annotated referents for entire statements, without annotated ref- erents for individual words or the parse struc- ture of the statement. We perform experiments on two applications: scene understanding and geographical question answering. We find that LSP outperforms existing, less expressive models that cannot represent relational lan- guage. We further find that weakly supervised training is competitive with fully supervised training while requiring significantly less an- notation effort.},

abstract = {The aim of this work is to enable the construction of artificial conversational agents capable of working in a multi-party setting. By an artificial conversational agent we mean a software agent (possibly with embodiment, personality etc.), capable of engaging in conversation with other conversational agents (human or artificial). By a multi-party setting we mean that more than two agents are engaged in the communication or dialogue. Components designed for two-party dialogue management including sequencing and turn management cannot, in general, handle multi-party dialogue phenomena, such as keeping track of the obligations regarding turn management and the rights and obligations to address an issue. We present an SCXML implementation of Issue-Based Dialogue Management, scaled up to handle more than two participants. The QUD-based dialogue manager makes a distinction between distributive questions (to be answered individually by each addressee) and collective questions (to be answered by the addressees collectively), in order to provide the right kind of grounding behaviour and in order to manage correctly the obligations put on the participants of the dialogue. The dialogue manager also features an SCXML implementation of the SSJ turn management model. We find that it is possible to scale up the Issue-Based Dialogue Management model from twoparty to multi-party dialogues, given that distributive and collective readings of questions can be identified.},

abstract = {Conversational systems play an important role in scenarios without a keyboard, e.g., talking to a robot. Communication in human-robot interaction (HRI) ultimately involves a combination of verbal and non-verbal inputs and outputs. HRI systems must process verbal and non-verbal observations and execute verbal and non-verbal actions in parallel, to interpret and produce synchronized behaviours. The development of such systems involves the integration of potentially many components and ensuring a complex interaction and synchronization between them. Most work in spoken dialogue system development uses pipeline architectures. Some exceptions are [1, 17], which execute system components in parallel (weakly-coupled or tightly-coupled architectures). The latter are more promising for building adaptive systems, which is one of the goals of contemporary research systems. In this paper we present an event-based approach for integrating a conversational HRI system. This approach has been instantiated using the Urbi middleware [6] on a Nao robot, used as a testbed for investigating child-robot interaction in the ALIZ-E project. We focus on the implementation for two scenarios: an imitation game of arm movements and a quiz game.},

abstract = {The paper presents work in progress on an implemented model of situated dialogue processing. The underlying assumption is that to understand situated dialogue, communicated meaning needs to be related to the situation(s) it refers to. The model couples incremental processing to a notion of bidirectional connectivity, inspired by how humans process visually situated language. Analyzing an utterance in a ''word-by-word, left-to-right'' fashion, a representation of possible utterance interpretations is gradually built up. In a top-down fashion, the model tries to ground these interpretations in situation awareness, through which they can prime what is focused on in a situation. In a bottom-up fashion, the (im)possibility to ground certain interpretations primes how the analysis of the utterance further unfolds. The paper discusses the implementation of the model in a distributed, cognitive architecture for human-robot interaction, and presents an evaluation on a test suite. The evaluation quantifies the effects linguistic interpretation has on priming utterance processing, and discusses how the evaluation can be extended to include situation context.},

abstract = {Current semantic theory on indexical expressions claims that demonstratively used indexicals such as this lack a referent-determining meaning but instead rely on an accompanying demonstration act like a pointing gesture. While this view allows to set up a sound logic of demonstratives, the direct-referential role assigned to pointing gestures has never been scrutinized thoroughly in semantics or pragmatics. We investigate the semantics and pragmatics of co-verbal pointing from a foundational perspective combining experiments, statistical investigation, computer simulation and theoretical modeling techniques in a novel manner. We evaluate various referential hypotheses with a corpus of object identification games set up in experiments in which body movement tracking techniques have been extensively used to generate precise pointing measurements. Statistical investigation and computer simulations show that especially distal areas in the pointing domain falsify the semantic direct-referential hypotheses concerning pointing gestures. As an alternative, we propose that reference involving pointing rests on a default inference which we specify using the empirical data. These results raise numerous problems for classical semantics-pragmatics interfaces: we argue for pre-semantic pragmatics in order to account for inferential reference in addition to classical post-semantic Gricean pragmatics.},

abstract = {A formal semantics for low-level perceptual aspects of meaning is presented, tying these together with the logical-inferential aspects of meaning traditionally studied in formal semantics. The key idea is to model perceptual meanings as classifiers of perceptual input. Furthermore, we show how perceptual aspects of meaning can be updated as a result of observing language use in interaction, thereby enabling fine-grained semantic plasticity and semantic coordination. This requires a framework where intensions are (i) represented independently of extensions, and (ii) structured objects which can be modified as a result of learning. We use Type Theory with Records (TTR), a formal semantics framework that starts from the idea that information and meaning is founded on our ability to perceive and classify the world, i.e. to perceive objects and situations as being of types. As an example of our approach, we show how a simple classifier of spatial information based on the Perceptron can be cast in TTR.},

abstract = {Following up on recent work on estab- lishing a mapping between vector-based semantic embeddings of words and the visual representations of the correspond- ing objects from natural images, we first present a simple approach to cross-modal vector-based semantics for the task of zero-shot learning, in which an image of a previously unseen object is mapped to a linguistic representation denoting its word. We then introduce fast mapping, a challenging and more cognitively plausi- ble variant of the zero-shot task, in which the learner is exposed to new objects and the corresponding words in very limited linguistic contexts. By combining prior linguistic and visual knowledge acquired about words and their objects, as well as exploiting the limited new evidence avail- able, the learner must learn to associate new objects with words. Our results on this task pave the way to realistic simula- tions of how children or robots could use existing knowledge to bootstrap grounded semantic knowledge about new concepts. 1},

Although discriminative models are gaining popularity due to their superior performance, generative models based on the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process model still remain at-tractive since they provide an integrated framework for dialog state tracking and dialog policy optimization. Although a straightforward way to fit a generative model is to independently train the com-ponent probability models, we present a gradient descent algorithm that simultane-ously train all the component models.

abstract = {Spoken dialog systems have difficulty selecting which action to take in a given situation because recognition and understanding errors are prevalent due to noise and unexpected inputs. To solve this problem, this paper presents a hybrid approach to improving robustness of the dialog manager by using agenda-based and example-based dialog modeling. This approach can exploit n-best hypotheses to determine the current dialog state in the dialog manager and keep track of the dialog state using a discourse interpretation algorithm based on an agenda graph and a focus stack. Given the agenda graph and multiple recognition hypotheses, the system can predict the next action to maximize multi-level score functions and trigger error recovery strategies to handle exceptional cases due to misunderstandings or unexpected focus shifts. The proposed method was tested by developing a spoken dialog system for a building guidance domain in an intelligent service robot. This system was then evaluated by simulated and real users. The experimental results show that our approach can effectively develop robust dialog management for spoken dialog systems. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper, a multi-stage spoken language understanding system is presented. This stochastic module is for the first time based on a combination of dynamic Bayesian networks and conditional random field classifiers. The former generative models allow to derive basic concept sequences from the word sequences which are in turn augmented with modalities and hierarchical information by the latter discriminative models. To provide efficiently smoothed conditional probability estimates, factored language models with a generalized parallel backoff procedure are used as the network edge implementation. This framework allows a great flexibility in terms of probability representation facilitating the development of the stochastic levels (semantic and lexical) of the system. Experiments are carried out on the French MEDIA task (tourist information and hotel booking). The MEDIA 10k-utterance training corpus is conceptually rich (more than 80 basic concepts) and is provided with a manually segmented annotation. On this complex task, the proposed multi-stage system is shown to offer better performance than the MEDIA'05 evaluation campaign best system (H. Bonneau-Maynard et al., 2006)},

abstract = {Preparing words in speech production is normally a fast and accurate process. We generate them two or three per second in fluent conversation; and overtly naming a clear picture of an object can easily be initiated within 600 msec after picture onset. The underlying process, however, is exceedingly complex. The theory reviewed in this target article analyzes this process as staged and feed-forward. After a first stage of conceptual preparation, word generation proceeds through lexical selection, morphological and phonological encoding, phonetic encoding, and articulation itself. In addition, the speaker exerts some degree of output control, by monitoring of self-produced internal and overt speech. The core of the theory, ranging from lexical selection to the initiation of phonetic encoding, is captured in a computational model, called WEAVER++. Both the theory and the computational model have been developed in interaction with reaction time experiments, particularly in picture naming or related word production paradigms, with the aim of accounting for the real-time processing in normal word production. A comprehensive review of theory, model, and experiments is presented. The model can handle some of the main observations in the domain of speech errors (the major empirical domain for most other theories of lexical access), and the theory opens new ways of approaching the cerebral organization of speech production by way of high-temporal-resolution imaging.},

abstract = {We have developed components of an automated system that understands and follows navigational instructions. The system has prior knowledge of the geometry and landmarks of specific maps. This knowledge is exploited to infer complex paths through maps based on natural language descriptions. The approach is based on an analysis of verbal commands in terms of elementary semantic units that are composed to generate a probability distribution over possible spatial paths in a map. An integration mechanism based on dynamic programming guides this language-to-path translation process, ensuring that resulting paths satisfy continuity and smoothness criteria. In the current implementation, parsing of text into semantic units is performed manually. Composition and interpretation of semantic units into spatial paths is performed automatically. In the evaluations, we show that the system accurately predicts the speakers' intended meanings for a range of instructions. This paper provides building blocks for a complete system that, when combined with robust parsing technologies, could lead to a fully automatic spatial language interpretation system.},

Entrainment, the phenomenon of dialogue partners becoming more similar to each other, is widely believed to be crucial to conversation quality and suc- cess.

Traditional approaches have focused on providing theoretical accounts for either the uncertainty or the complexity of spo- ken dialogue, but rarely considered the two issues simultaneously. This paper de- scribes ongoing work on a new approach to dialogue management which attempts to fill this gap. We represent the interac- tion as a Partially Observable Markov De- cision Process (POMDP) over a rich state space incorporating both dialogue, user, and environment models. The tractability of the resulting POMDP can be preserved using a mechanism for dynamically con- straining the action space based on prior knowledge over locally relevant dialogue structures. These constraints are encoded in a small set of general rules expressed as a Markov Logic network. The first-order expressivity of Markov Logic enables us to leverage the rich relational structure of the problem and efficiently abstract over large regions of the state and action spaces.},

abstract = {This thesis presents a new modelling framework for dialogue management based on the concept of probabilistic rules. Probabilistic rules are defined as if...then...else constructions associating logical conditions on input variables to probabilistic effects over output variables. These rules function as high-level templates for the generation of a directed graphical model. Their expressive power allows them to represent the probabilistic models employed in dialogue management in a compact and efficient manner. As a consequence, they can drastically reduce the amount of interaction data required for parameter estimation as well as enhance the system's ability to generalise over unseen situations. Furthermore, probabilistic rules can also be exploited to encode domain-specific constraints and assumptions into statistical models of dialogue, thereby enabling system designers to incorporate their expert knowledge of the problem structure in a concise and human-readable form. Due to their integration of logical and probabilistic reasoning, we argue that probabilistic rules are particularly well suited to devise hybrid models of dialogue management that can account for both the complexity and uncertainty that characterise many dialogue domains. The thesis also demonstrates how the parameters of probabilistic rules can be efficiently es- timated using both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques. In the case of supervised learning, the rule parameters are learned by imitation on the basis of small amounts of Wizard- of-Oz data. Alternatively, rule parameters can also be optimised via trial and error from repeated interactions with a (real or simulated) user. Both learning strategies rely on Bayesian inference to iteratively estimate the parameter values and provide the best fit for the observed interaction data. Three consecutive experiments conducted in a human–robot interaction domain attest to the practical viability of the proposed framework and its advantages over traditional approaches. In particular, the empirical results of a user evaluation with 37 participants show that a dialogue man- ager structured with probabilistic rules outperforms both purely hand-crafted and purely statistical methods on an extensive range of subjective and objective metrics of dialogue quality. The modelling framework presented in this thesis is implemented in a new software toolkit called OpenDial, which is made freely available to the research community and can be used to develop various types of dialogue systems based on probabilistic rules.},

abstract = {Probabilistic models such as Bayesian Networks are now in widespread use in spoken dialogue systems, but their scalability to complex interaction domains remains a challenge. One central limitation is that the state space of such models grows exponentially with the problem size, which makes parameter estimation increasingly difficult, especially for domains where only limited training data is available. In this paper, we show how to capture the underlying structure of a dialogue domain in terms of probabilistic rules operating on the dialogue state. The probabilistic rules are associated with a small, compact set of parameters that can be directly estimated from data. We argue that the introduction of this abstraction mechanism yields probabilistic models that are easier to learn and generalise bet- ter than their unstructured counterparts. We empirically demonstrate the benefits of such an approach learning a dialogue policy for a human-robot interaction domain based on a Wizard-of-Oz data set.},

abstract = {We present a new modelling framework for dialogue management based on the concept of probabilistic rules. Probabilistic rules are defined as structured mappings between logical conditions and probabilistic effects. They function as high-level templates for probabilistic graphical models and may include unknown parameters whose values are estimated from data using Bayesian inference. Thanks to their use of logical abstractions, probabilistic rules are able to encode the probability and utility models employed in dialogue management in a compact and human-readable form. As a consequence, they can reduce the amount of dialogue data required for parameter estimation and allow system designers to directly incorporate their expert domain knowledge into the dialogue models.$\backslash$nEmpirical results of a user evaluation in a human–robot interaction task with 37 participants show that a dialogue manager structured with probabilistic rules outperforms both purely hand-crafted and purely statistical methods on a range of subjective and objective quality metrics. The framework is implemented in a software toolkit called OpenDial, which can be used to develop various types of dialogue systems based on probabilistic rules.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning methods are increasingly used to optimise dialogue policies from experience. Most current techniques are model-free: they directly estimate the utility of various actions, without explicit model of the interaction dynamics. In this paper, we investigate an alternative strategy grounded in model-based Bayesian reinforcement learning. Bayesian inference is used to maintain a posterior distribution over the model parameters, reflecting the model uncertainty. This parameter distribution is gradually refined as more data is collected and simultaneously used to plan the agent's actions. Within this learning framework, we carried out experiments with two alternative formalisations of the transition model, one encoded with standard multinomial distributions, and one structured with probabilistic rules. We demonstrate the potential of our approach with empirical results on a user simulator constructed from Wizard-of-Oz data in a human-robot interaction scenario. The results illustrate in particular the benefits of capturing prior domain knowledge with high-level rules.},

Albeit for different reasons, in both accounts the importance of statistical regularities in linguistic surface structure tends to be underestimated. The current article gives an overview of the symbolic and embodied cognition accounts and shows how meaning induction attributed to a specific statistical process or to activation of embodied representations should be attributed to language itself. Specifically, the performance of LSA can be attributed to the linguistic surface structure, more than special characteristics of the algorithm, and embodiment findings attributed to perceptual simulations can be explained by distributional linguistic information.},

This paper presents an efficient, simple technique that parses a semantic tree by recursively calling discriminative semantic classification models. Results show that it outperforms methods based on the Hidden Vector State model and Markov Logic Networks, while performance is close to more complex grammar induction techniques. We also show that our method is robust to speech recognition errors, by improving over a handcrafted parser previously used for dialogue data collection.},

METHOD: This study investigated typical eating behavior (meal frequency and snacking) and atypical eating behavior among 311 community women with on-line questionnaires. Participants were classified with bulimia nervosa (BN; n =39), binge eating disorder (BED; n = 69), or controls (CON; n = 203). RESULTS: In terms of typical eating behaviors, the BN group ate significantly fewer meals, particularly lunches, than the other two groups. Atypical eating, such as nibbling, eating double meals and nocturnal eating, was significantly more common in the eating disorder groups. More frequent breakfast consumption was associated with lower BMI in the BED and CON groups, and more frequent meal consumption was associated with less binge eating in the BED group only. DISCUSSION: Our study revealed differences in typical and atypical eating patterns, and associations with weight and eating disorder behaviors among eating disorder and control groups.},

abstract = {As robots become more ubiquitous, it is increasingly important for untrained users to be able to interact with them intuitively. In this work, we investigate how people refer to objects in the world during relatively unstructured communication with robots.

Recently, this has led to study of the lan- guage grounding problem, where the goal is to extract representations of the mean- ings of natural language tied to the physi- cal world. We present an approach for joint learning of language and perception models for grounded attribute induction. The per- ception model includes classifiers for phys- ical characteristics and a language model based on a probabilistic categorial grammar that enables the construction of composi- tional meaning representations. We evaluate on the task of interpreting sentences that de- scribe sets of objects in a physical workspace, and demonstrate accurate task performance and effective latent-variable concept induc- tion in physical grounded scenes. 1.},

Interviews with drivers in hospital and phone company's records of phone use.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Driver's use of a mobile phone up to 10 minutes before a crash was associated with a fourfold increased likelihood of crashing (odds ratio 4.1, 95{\%} confidence interval 2.2 to 7.7, P {\textless} 0.001). Risk was raised irrespective of whether or not a hands-free device was used (hands-free: 3.8, 1.8 to 8.0, P {\textless} 0.001; hand held: 4.9, 1.6 to 15.5, P = 0.003). Increased risk was similar in men and women and in drivers aged {\textgreater} or = 30 and {\textless} 30 years. A third (n = 21) of calls before crashes and on trips during the previous week were reportedly on hand held phones.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: When drivers use a mobile phone there is an increased likelihood of a crash resulting in injury. Using a hands-free phone is not any safer.},

abstract = {Traditional dialogue systems use a fixed silence threshold to detect the end of users' turns. Such a simplistic model can result in system behaviour that is both interruptive and unresponsive, which in turn affects user experience. Various studies have observed that human interlocutors take cues from speaker behaviour, such as prosody, syntax, and gestures, to coordinate smooth exchange of speaking turns. However, little effort has been made towards implementing these models in dialogue systems and verifying how well they model the turn-taking behaviour in human-computer interactions. We present a data-driven approach to building models for online detection of suitable feedback response locations in the user's speech. We first collected human-computer interaction data using a spoken dialogue system that can perform the Map Task with users (albeit using a trick). On this data, we trained various models that use automatically extractable prosodic, contextual and lexico-syntactic features for detecting response locations. Next, we implemented a trained model in the same dialogue system and evaluated it in interactions with users. The subjective and objective measures from the user evaluation confirm that a model trained on speaker behavioural cues offers both smoother turn-transitions and more responsive system behaviour. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Semantic frame structures are directly derived from word and basic concept sequences representing the users' utterances. A rule-based process provides a reference frame annotation of the speech training data. Then dynamic Bayesian networks are used to hypothesize frames from test data. The semantic frames used in this work are specialized on the task domain from the Berkeley FrameNet set. Experiments are reported on the French MEDIA dialog corpus. For all the data, the manual transcriptions and annotations at the word and concept levels are available. Tests are performed under 3 different conditions raising in difficulty wrt the errors in the word and concept sequence inputs. Three different stochastic models are compared and the results confirm the ability of the proposed probabilistic frameworks to carry out a reliable semantic frame annotation.},

abstract = {Robust spoken language understanding (SLU) is a key component of spoken dialogue systems. Recent statistical approaches to this problem require additional resources (e.g. gazetteers, grammars, syntactic treebanks) which are expensive and time-consuming to produce and maintain. However, simple datasets annotated only with slot-values are commonly used in dialogue systems development, and are easy to collect, automatically annotate, and update. We show that it is possible to reach state-of-the-art performance using minimal additional resources, by using Markov logic networks (MLNs). We also show that performance can be further improved by exploiting long distance dependencies between slot-values. For example, by representing such features in MLNs, but without using a gazetteer, we outperform the hidden vector state (HVS) model of He and Young 2006 (1.26{\%} improvement, a 13{\%} error reduction).},

We use three different semantic spaces and implement seven tensor-based compositional models, which we then test (together with simpler additive and multiplicative approaches) in tasks involving verb disambiguation and sentence similarity. To check their scalability, we additionally evaluate the spaces using simple compositional methods on larger-scale tasks with less constrained language: paraphrase detection and di- alogue act tagging. In the more constrained tasks, co-occurrence vectors are competitive, although choice of compositional method is important; on the larger-scale tasks, they are outperformed by neural word embeddings, which show robust, stable performance across the tasks.},

abstract = {Vector-based models of word meaning have become increasingly popular in cognitive science. The appeal of these models lies in their ability to represent meaning simply by using distributional information under the assumption that words occurring within similar contexts are semantically similar. Despite their widespread use, vector-based models are typically directed at representing words in isolation, and methods for constructing representations for phrases or sentences have received little attention in the literature. This is in marked contrast to experimental evidence (e.g., in sentential priming) suggesting that semantic similarity is more complex than simply a relation between isolated words. This article proposes a framework for representing the meaning of word combinations in vector space. Central to our approach is vector composition, which we operationalize in terms of additive and multiplicative functions. Under this framework, we introduce a wide range of composition models that we evaluate empirically on a phrase similarity task.},

abstract = {Vector-based models of word meaning have become increasingly popular in cognitive science. The appeal of these models lies in their ability to represent meaning simply by using distributional information under the assumption that words occurring within similar contexts are semantically similar. Despite their widespread use, vector-based models are typically directed at representing words in isolation, and methods for constructing representations for phrases or sentences have received little attention in the literature. This is in marked contrast to experimental evidence (e.g., in sentential priming) suggesting that semantic similarity is more complex than simply a relation between isolated words. This article proposes a framework for representing the meaning of word combinations in vector space. Central to our approach is vector composition, which we operationalize in terms of additive and multiplicative functions. Under this framework, we introduce a wide range of composition models that we evaluate empirically on a phrase similarity task.},

abstract = {There are many references that concern a specific aspect of speaker tracking. This paper focuses on the speaker modeling issue and proposes conditional random fields (CRF) for this purpose. CRF is a class of undirected graphical models for classifying sequential data. CRF has some interesting characteristics which have encouraged us to use this model in a speaker modeling and tracking task. The main concern of CRF model is its training. Known approaches for CRF training are prone to overfitting and unreliable convergence. To solve this problem, variational approaches are proposed in this paper. The main novelty of this paper is to adapt variational framework for CRF training. The resulted approach is evaluated on three different areas. First, the best CRF model configuration for speaker modeling is evaluated on text independent speaker verification. Next, the selected model is used in a speaker detection task, in which the models of the existing speakers in the conversation are known a priori. Then, the proposed CRF approach is compared with GMM in an online speaker tracking framework. The results show that the proposed CRF model is superior to GMM in speaker detection and tracking, due to its capability for sequence modeling and segmentation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

abstract = {Comparison of generative and discriminative classifiers is an ever-lasting topic. As an important contribution to this topic, based on their theoretical and empirical comparisons between the naive Bayes classifier and linear logistic regression, Ng and Jordan (NIPS 841-848, 2001) claimed that there exist two distinct regimes of performance between the generative and discriminative classifiers with regard to the training-set size. In this paper, our empirical and simulation studies, as a complement of their work, however, suggest that the existence of the two distinct regimes may not be so reliable. In addition, for real world datasets, so far there is no theoretically correct, general criterion for choosing between the discriminative and the generative approaches to classification of an observation x into a class y; the choice depends on the relative confidence we have in the correctness of the specification of either p(y vertical bar x) or p(x, y) for the data. This can be to some extent a demonstration of why Efron (J Am Stat Assoc 70(352):892-898, 1975) and O'Neill (J Am Stat Assoc 75(369):154-160, 1980) prefer normal-based linear discriminant analysis (LDA) when no model mis-specification occurs but other empirical studies may prefer linear logistic regression instead. Furthermore, we suggest that pairing of either LDA assuming a common diagonal covariance matrix (LDA-A) or the naive Bayes classifier and linear logistic regression may not be perfect, and hence it may not be reliable for any claim that was derived from the comparison between LDA-A or the naive Bayes classifier and linear logistic regression to be generalised to all generative and discriminative classifiers.},

We present Tuffy that achieves scalability via three novel contributions: (1) a bottom-up approach to grounding that allows us to leverage the full power of the relational optimizer, (2) a novel hybrid architecture that allows us to perform AI-style local search efficiently using an RDBMS, and (3) a theoretical insight that shows when one can (exponentially) improve the efficiency of stochastic local search. We leverage (3) to build novel partitioning, loading, and parallel algorithms.

abstract = {Parsing algorithms that process the input from left to right and construct a single derivation have often been considered inadequate for natural language parsing because of the massive ambiguity typically found in natural language grammars. Nevertheless, it has been shown that such algorithms, combined with treebank-induced classifiers, can be used to build highly accurate disambiguating parsers, in particular for dependency-based syntactic representations. In this article, we first present a general framework for describing and analyzing algorithms for deterministic incremental dependency parsing, formalized as transition systems. We then describe and analyze two families of such algorithms: stack-based and list-based algorithms. In the former family, which is restricted to projective dependency structures, we describe an arc-eager and an arc-standard variant; in the latter family, we present a projective and a non-projective variant. For each of the four algorithms, we give proofs of correctness and complexity. In addition, we perform an experimental evaluation of all algorithms in combination with SVM classifiers for predicting the next parsing action, using data from thirteen languages. We show that all four algorithms give competitive accuracy, although the non-projective list-based algorithm generally outperforms the projective algorithms for languages with a non-negligible proportion of non-projective constructions. However, the projective algorithms often produce comparable results when combined with the technique known as pseudo-projective parsing. The linear time complexity of the stack-based algorithms gives them an advantage with respect to efficiency both in learning and in parsing, but the projective list-based algorithm turns out to be equally efficient in practice. Moreover, when the projective algorithms are used to implement pseudo-projective parsing, they sometimes become less efficient in parsing (but not in learning) than the non-projective list-based algorithm. Although most of the algorithms have been partially described in the literature before, this is the first comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the algorithms within a unified framework.},

The experiments show that unrestricted non-projective parsing gives a significant improvement in accuracy, compared to a strictly projective baseline, with up to 35{\%} error reduction, leading to state-of-the-art results for the given data sets.

abstract = {Event detection is used to classify recorded gaze points into periods of fixation, saccade, smooth pursuit, blink, and noise. Although there is an overall consensus that current algorithms for event detection have serious flaws and that a de facto standard for event detection does not exist, surprisingly little work has been done to remedy this problem. We suggest a new velocity-based algorithm that takes several of the previously known limitations into account. Most important, the new algorithm identifies so-called glissades, a wobbling movement at the end of many saccades, as a separate class of eye movements. Part of the solution involves designing an adaptive velocity threshold that makes the event detection less sensitive to variations in noise level and the algorithm settings-free for the user. We demonstrate the performance of the new algorithm on eye movements recorded during reading and scene perception and compare it with two of the most commonly used algorithms today. Results show that, unlike the currently used algorithms, fixations, saccades, and glissades are robustly identified by the new algorithm. Using this algorithm, we found that glissades occur in about half of the saccades, during both reading and scene perception, and that they have an average duration close to 24 msec. Due to the high prevalence and long durations of glissades, we argue that researchers must actively choose whether to assign the glissades to saccades or fixations; the choice affects dependent variables such as fixation and saccade duration significantly. Current algorithms do not offer this choice, and their assignments of each glissade are largely arbitrary.},

abstract = {Intentions in Communication brings together major theorists from artificial intelligence and computer science, linguistics, philosophy, and psychology whose work develops the foundations for an account of the role of intentions in a comprehensive theory of communication. It demonstrates, for the first time, the emerging cooperation among disciplines concerned with the fundamental role of intention in communication.The fourteen contributions in this book address central questions about the nature of intention as it is understood in theories of communication, the crucial role of intention recognition in understanding utterances, the use of principles of rational interaction in interpreting speech acts, the contribution of intonation contours to intention recognition, and the need for more general models of intention that support a view of dialogue as a collaborative activity.The contributors are Michael E. Bratman, Philip R. Cohen, Hector J. Levesque, Martha E. Pollack, Henry Kautz, Andrew J. I. Jones, C. Raymond Perrault, Daniel Vanderveken, Janet Pierrehumbert, Julia Hirschberg, Richmond H. Thomason, Diane J Litman, James F. Allen, John R. Searle, Barbara J. Grosz, Candace L. Sidner, Herbert H. Clark and Deanna Wilkes-Gibbs. The book also includes commentaries by James F. Allen, W. A Woods, Jerry Morgan, Jerrold M. Sadock Jerry R. Hobbs, and Kent Bach.Philip R.

Also desirable would be the abil-ity to handle repairs and other modifications to exist-ing instructions. To this end, we collected a corpus of spoken instructions (and modified instructions) produced by subjects provided with an origin and a destination. We found that instructions could be classified into four categories, depending on their intent such as imperative, feedback, or meta com-ment. We asked a different set of subjects to fol-low these instructions to determine the usefulness and comprehensibility of individual instructions. Fi-nally, we constructed a semantic grammar and evalu-ated its coverage. To determine whether instruction-giving forms a predictable sub-language, we tested the grammar on three corpora collected by others and determined that this was largely the case. Our work suggests that predictable sub-languages may exist for well-defined tasks.},

@article{Partee1975,
abstract = {A theory of grammar (syntax {\&} semantics) is proposed combining the most essential feature of Richard Montague's theory of syntax {\&} semantics {\&} the transformational approach to syntax. The resulting theory is closer to Montague than to any of the current versions of transformational grammar; nevertheless, close analogues of most of the rules (both phrase structure {\&} transformational) formulated by transformationalists can be naturally included in the new theory. Montague's central working premise, carried over here, is that the syntactic rules determining how a sentence is built out of smaller syntactic parts should correspond 1-to-1 with the semantic rules telling how the meaning of a sentence is a function of the meanings of its parts. This idea is not new in either linguistics or philosophy - in philosophy it has its basis in the work of Frege, Tarski, {\&} Carnap; it is also standard in the treatment of formalized languages; {\&} in transformational grammar it can be found in Katz {\&} Fodor's earliest work on semantics (1963). However, with a few exceptions (e.g., Reichenbach, 1947), philosophers before Montague have applied this principle only to describing constructed languages {\&} have sometimes expressed skepticism as to whether natural languages would even admit of such a description. Linguists, on the other hand, have attempted to apply principles of syntactic-semantic correspondence to natural languages, but their definitions of semantic theory have diverged considerably from the philosophico-logical tradition. Alternative conceptions of semantics are proposed, {\&} the suggestion that there is no principled reason for linguists to eschew the philosophico-logical conception of semantics is proposed on the basis that there are in fact some good reasons for adopting it. The 2nd {\&} largest section of the article - primarily for linguists - is devoted to an explication of Montague's approach to syntax {\&} semantics. In the 3rd section - primarily addressed to philosophers - main features of transformational syntax {\&} problems raised in various attempts to add semantics to the theory are discussed. HA},

We present methods for estimating and communicating about different uncertainties in situated interaction, leveraging the affordances of an embodied conversational agent. The approach harnesses a representation that captures both the magnitude and the sources of uncertainty, and a set of policies that select and coordinate the production of nonverbal and verbal behaviors to communicate the system's uncertainties to conversational participants. The methods are designed to enlist participants' help in a natural manner to resolve uncertainties arising during interactions. We report on a preliminary implementation of the proposed methods in a deployed system and illustrate the functionality with a trace from a sample interaction.},

abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of extensional and intensional logic. The usual kind of extensional semantics as based on: (1) letting terms denote the objects they name; (2) letting sentences denote truth values; and (3) letting expressions of all other categories stand for functions constructed from individuals and truth values. Probably the most general language of extensional logic, based on the most consequential exploitation of Frege's maneuver, was put forward by Alonzo under the name of the simple theory of types. The most famous system of modal predicate logic was presented by Richard. He called the system intensional logic and this term has been almost universally accepted. The basic idea was that of explicating intensions generally as functions from possible worlds to extensions. This was compatible with the relationship seen between the extension of a sentence and its Kripkean intension: the intension of a sentence could be seen as a function mapping each world on the truth value of the sentence for that world. This chapter elaborates on modal logic, modal predicate logic, and Montague's "locally" intensional logic. Concepts of "globally" intensional logic are explained. A discussion on Quine's extensionalist program is also presented in this chapter. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In face to face interaction, we can complement verbal expressions with gestures and, hence, we do not need to be too precise in our verbal protocols. Our interlocutors hear our speaking; see our gestures and they even read our eyes. They interpret our deictic expressions, try to identify the referents and – normally – they will understand. If only machines could do alike. The driving vision behind the research in this thesis are multimodal conversational interfaces where humans are engaged in natural dialogues with computer systems. The embodied conversational agent Max developed in the A.I. group at Bielefeld University is an example of such an interface. Max is already able to produce multimodal deictic expressions using speech, gaze and gestures, but his capabilities to understand humans are not on par. If he was able to resolve multimodal deictic expressions, his understanding of humans would increase and interacting with him would become more natural. Following this vision, we as scientists are confronted with several challenges. First, accurate models for human pointing have to be found. Second, precise data on multimodal interactions has to be collected, integrated and analyzed in order to create these models. This data is multimodal (transcripts, voice and video recordings, annotations) and not directly accessible for analysis (voice and video recordings). Third, technologies have to be developed to support the integration and the analysis of the multimodal data. Fourth, the created models have to be implemented, evaluated and optimized until they allow a natural interaction with the conversational interface. To this ends, this work aims to deepen our knowledge of human non-verbal deixis, specifically of manual and gaze pointing, and to apply this knowledge in conversational interfaces. At the core of the theoretical and empirical investigations of this thesis are models for the interpretation of pointing gestures to objects. These models address the following questions: When are we pointing? Where are we pointing to? Which objects are we pointing at? With respect to these questions, this thesis makes the following three contributions: First, gaze-based interaction technology for 3D environments: Gaze plays an important role in human communication, not only in deictic reference. Yet, technology for gaze interaction is still less developed than technology for manual interaction. In this thesis, we have developed components for real-time tracking of eye movements and of the point of regard in 3D space and integrated them in a framework for Deictic Reference In Virtual Environments (DRIVE). DRIVE provides viable information about human communicative behavior in real-time. This data can be used to investigate and to design processes on higher cognitive levels, such as turn-taking, check-backs, shared attention and resolving deictic reference. Second, data-driven modeling: We answer the theoretical questions about timing, direction, accuracy and dereferential power of pointing by data-driven modeling. As empirical basis for the simulations, we created a substantial corpus with highprecision data from an extensive study on multimodal pointing. Two further studies complemented this effort with substantial data on gaze pointing in 3D. Based on this data, we have developed several models of pointing and successfully created a model for the interpretation of manual pointing that achieves a human-like performance level. Third, new methodologies for research on multimodal deixis in the fields of linguistics and computer science: The experimental-simulative approach to modeling – which we follow in this thesis – requires large collections of heterogeneous data to be recorded, integrated, analyzed and resimulated. To support the researcher in these tasks, we developed the Interactive Augmented Data Explorer (IADE). IADE is an innovative tool for research on multimodal interaction based on virtual reality technology. It allows researchers to literally immerse into multimodal data and interactively explore them in real-time and in virtual space. With IADE we have also extended established approaches for scientific visualization of linguistic data to 3D, which previously existed only for 2D methods of analysis (e.g. video recordings or computer screen experiments). By this means, we extended Mc-Neill's 2D depiction of the gesture space to gesture space volumes expanding in time and space. Similarly, we created attention volumes, a new way to visualize the distribution of attention in 3D environments.},

In accord with rational theories of communication, we show across 10 languages that average information content is a much better predictor of word length than frequency. This indicates that human lexicons are efficiently structured for communication by taking into account interword statistical dependencies. Lexical systems result from an optimization of communicative pressures, coding meanings efficiently given the complex statistics of natural language use.},

@article{Pineda2000,
abstract = {An important aspect of the interpretation of multimodal messages is the ability to identify when the same object in the world is the referent of symbols in different modalities. To understand the caption of a picture, for instance, one needs to identify the graphical symbols that are referred to by names and pronouns in the natural language text. One way to think of this problem is in terms oft he notion of anaphora; however, unlike linguistic anaphoric inference, in which antecedents for pronouns are selected from a linguistic context, in the interpretation of the textual part of multimodal messages the antecedents ave selected from a graphical context. Under this view, resolving multimodal references is like resolving anaphora across modalities. Another way to see the same problem is to look at pronouns in texts about drawings as deictic. In this second view, the context of interpretation of a natural language term is defined asa set of expressions of a graphical language with well-defined syntax and semantics. Natural language and graphical terms are thought of as standing in a relation of translation similar to the translation relation that holds between natural languages. In this paper a theory based on this second view is presented. In this theory, the relations between multimodal representation and spatial deixis, on the one hand, and multimodal reasoning and deictic inference, on the other, are discussed. An integrated model of anaphoric and deictic resolution in the context of the interpretation of multimodal discourse is also advanced."},

Dialogue systems can be modeled effectively using POMDPs, achieving improvements in robustness. However, past research on POMDPs-based dialogue system assumes that the model parameters are known. This limitation can be addressed through model-based Bayesian reinforcement learning, which offers a rich framework for simultaneous learning and planning. However, due to the high complexity of the framework, a major challenge is to scale up these algorithms for complex dialogue systems. In this work, we show that by exploiting certain known components of the system, such as knowledge of symmetrical properties, and using an approximate online planning algorithm, we are able to apply Bayesian RL on a realistic spoken dialogue system domain.},

abstract = {We present the results of a study of definite descriptions use in written texts aimed at assessing the feasibility of annotating corpora with information about definite description interpretation. We ran two experiments, in which subjects were asked to classify the uses of definite descriptions in a corpus of 33 newspaper articles, containing a total of 1412 definite descriptions. We measured the agreement among annotators about the classes assigned to definite descriptions, as well as the agreement about the antecedent assigned to those definites that the annotators classified as being related to an antecedent in the text. The most interesting result of this study from a corpus annotation perspective was the rather low agreement (K=0.63) that we obtained using versions of Hawkins' and Prince's classification schemes; better results (K=0.76) were obtained using the simplified scheme proposed by Fraurud that includes only two classes, first-mention and subsequent-mention. The agreement about antecedents was also not complete. These findings raise questions concerning the strategy of evaluating systems for definite description interpretation by comparing their results with a standardized annotation. From a linguistic point of view, the most interesting observations were the great number of discourse-new definites in our corpus (in one of our experiments, about 50{\%} of the definites in the collection were classified as discourse-new, 30{\%} as anaphoric, and 18{\%} as associative/bridging) and the presence of definites which did not seem to require a complete disambiguation.},

Specifically, we present an integrated probabilistic framework that combines speech and eye-gaze for reference resolution. We further examine the relationship between eyegaze and increased domain modeling with corresponding linguistic processing. Our empirical results show that the incorporation of eye-gaze significantly improves reference resolution performance. This improvement is most dramatic when a simple domain model is used. Our results also show that minimal domain modeling combined with eye-gaze significantly outperforms complex domain modeling without eye-gaze, which indicates that eye-gaze can be used to potentially compensate a lack of domain modeling for reference resolution.},

@article{Putnam1973,
abstract = {UNCLEAR as it is, the traditional doctrine that the notion "meaning" possesses the extension/intension ambiguity has certain typical consequences. The doctrine that the meaning of a term is a concept carried the implication that mean- ings are mental entities. Frege, however, rebelled against this "psy- chologism." Feeling that meanings are public property-that the same meaning can be "grasped" by more than one person and by persons at different times-he identified concepts (and hence "intensions" or meanings) with abstract entities rather than mental entities. However, "grasping" these abstract entities was still an individual psychological act. None of these philosophers doubted that understanding a word (knowing its intension) was just a matter of being in a certain psychological state (somewhat in the way in which knowing how to factor numbers in one's head is just a mat- ter of being in a certain very complex psychological state).},

In most cases, no relations between concepts are modeled, and both concepts and relations are domain-specific, making it difficult to expand or port the domain model. In contrast, we expand our previous work on a domain model based on an ontology where concepts follow the predicate-argument semantics and domain-independent classical relations are defined on such concepts. We conduct a thorough study on a spoken dialog corpus collected within a customer care problem-solving domain, and we evaluate the coverage and impact of the ontology for the interpretation, grounding and re-ranking of spoken language understanding interpretations.},

abstract = {In learning the meanings of words, children are guided by a set of constraints that give privilege to some potential meanings over others. These word-learning constraints are sometimes viewed as part of a specifically linguistic endowment. However, several recent computational models suggest concretely how word-learning - constraints included - might emerge from more general aspects of cognition, such as associative learning, attention and rational inference. This article reviews these models, highlighting the link between general cognitive forces and the word-learning they subserve. Ultimately, these cognitive forces might leave their mark not just on language learning, but also on language itself: in constraining the space of possible meanings, they place limits on cross-linguistic semantic variation.},

In this paper, we identify a gap in existing implementations of many of the popular algorithms, which is their scalability and ease of use. We describe a Natural Language Processing software framework which is based on the idea of document streaming, i.e. processing corpora document after document, in a memory independent fashion. Within this framework, we implement several popular algorithms for topical inference, including Latent Semantic Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, in a way that makes them completely independent of the training corpus size. Particular emphasis is placed on straightforward and intuitive framework design, so that modifications and extensions of the methods and/or their application by interested practitioners are effortless. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach on a real-world scenario of computing document similarities within an existing digital library DML-CZ.},

Indeed, it can be argued that the most frequent behaviour of human beings is movement of the eyes (Bridgeman, 1992). This ceaseless twitching, as one early researcher described it (Stratton, 1906), is the visual systems solution to the huge amount of available visual information and limited processing resources.

Together with a set of constants representing objects in the domain, it specifies a ground Markov network containing one feature for each possible grounding of a first-order formula in the KB, with the corresponding weight. Inference in MLNs is performed by MCMC over the minimal subset of the ground network required for answering the query. Weights are efficiently learned from relational databases by iteratively optimizing a pseudo-likelihood measure. Optionally, additional clauses are learned using inductive logic programming techniques. Experiments with a real-world database and knowledge base in a university domain illustrate the promise of this approach.},

abstract = {This paper describes the functioning of a broad-coverage probabilistic top-down parser, and its application to the problem of language modeling for speech recognition. The paper first introduces key notions in language modeling and probabilistic parsing, and briefly reviews some previous approaches to using syntactic structure for language modeling. A lexicalized probabilistic top-down parser is then presented, which performs very well, in terms of both the accuracy of returned parses and the efficiency with which they are found, relative to the best broad-coverage statistical parsers. A new language model which utilizes probabilistic top-down parsing is then outlined, and empirical results show that it improves upon previous work in test corpus perplexity. Interpolation with a trigram model yields an exceptional improvement relative to the improvement observed by other models, demonstrating the degree to which the information captured by our parsing model is orthogonal to that captured by a trigram model. A small recognition experiment also demonstrates the utility of the model.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To retrospectively assess, with three-dimensional rotational angiography, the relationship between packing, complex coils, and angiographic recurrence of aneurysms treated with coils. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Informed consent was waived by the institutional review board that approved the study. Results at follow-up angiography of 255 aneurysms in 223 patients (161 female and 62 male patients; mean age, 48 years) were dichotomized into presence or absence of recurrence. The degree of packing of aneurysms treated with complex coils alone, with complex and helical coils, and with helical coils only was compared for significant differences. With generalized estimating equations analysis, relative risk (RR) for recurrence was calculated for mode of manifestation, duration of follow-up, aneurysm volume, packing, initial angiographic result, percentage of complex coils, aneurysm location, and multiplicity of aneurysms. RESULTS: Follow-up angiography revealed recurrence in 28.6{\%} of aneurysms at a mean follow-up of 12 months; 5.5{\%} were amenable to re-treatment. Aneurysms treated with complex and those treated with helical coils only had a mean packing of 27{\%} and 26{\%}, respectively. There was no significant difference between packing of aneurysms treated with complex and those treated with helical coils (P = .538). Recurring and stable aneurysms both had a mean packing of 27{\%}. Generalized estimating equations analysis showed significant differences between duration of follow-up and recurrence (P = .001, RR = 3.39), between aneurysm volume and recurrence (P {\textless} .001, RR = 6.15), and between hemorrhagic manifestation and recurrence (P = .002, RR = 3.17). There was no significant difference between packing and recurrence, between initial angiographic result and recurrence, between percentage of complex coils and recurrence, between aneurysm location and recurrence, or between multiplicity of aneurysms and recurrence. CONCLUSION: More angiographic recurrences are detected over time. Complex coils do not augment aneurysm packing. Packing is not related to protection against recurrence.},

This research is reviewed and related to measures of abilities operationalized in existing aptitude tests, as well as to measures of abilities that are the focus of more recent research in cognitive psychology. Finally, prospects for developing aptitude tests to serve the purposes of predicting both early and advanced level language learning success are discussed in the light of the SLA findings and aptitude frameworks reviewed.},

abstract = {We report a new phenomenon associated with language comprehension: the action-sentence compatibility effect (ACE). Participants judged whether sentences were sensible by making a response that required moving toward or away from their bodies. When a sentence implied action in one direction (e.g., "Close the drawer" implies action away from the body), the participants had difficulty making a sensibility judgment requiring a response in the opposite direction. The ACE was demonstrated for three sentences types: imperative sentences, sentences describing the transfer of concrete objects, and sentences describing the transfer of abstract entities, such as "Liz told you the story." These dataare inconsistent with theories of language comprehension in which meaning is represented as a set of relations among nodes. Instead, the data support an embodied theory of meaning that relates the meaning of sentences to human action.},

In both domains, the presumed "natural" categories were consistently easier to learn than the "distorted" categories. Even when not central, natural prototype stimuli tended to be more rapidly learned and more often chosen as the most typical example of the category than were other stimuli.

It is some of the most exciting work in cognitive science, unifying neural and cognitive processes in a highly computational framework, with links to artificial intelligence. Although thought and problem solving have a sequential character when viewed over a time frame of minutes or hours, the authors argue that each step in the sequence is the result of the simultaneous activity of a large number of simple computational elements, each influencing others and being influenced by them. Parallel Distributed Processing describes their work in developing a theoretical framework for describing this parallel distributed processing activity and in applying the framework to the development of models of aspects of perception, memory, language, and thought. Volume 1 lays the theoretical foundations of parallel distributed processing. It introduces the approach and the reasons why the authors feel it is a fruitful one, describes several models of basic mechanisms with wide applicability to different problems, and presents a number of specific technical analyses of different aspects of parallel distributed models.},

Intervention led to improvement in his expressive abilities, and by 4;2 the deviant utterance patterns had disappeared. In later years, his spontaneous speech and school performance were normal, though language testing revealed some weak areas. The younger child initially used no speech, but acquired language normally after intervention, with his brother as model.

Our experimental results show that this new strategy significantly improves upon the reliability of the decoupled planning approach.

We perform extensive experimentation by comparing different tree-based kernels with a variety of representations of the available linguistic information, including semantic concepts, words, POS tags, shallow and full syntax, and discourse trees. The results show that the structured representation with the semantic concepts yields significant improvement over the base CSL parser, much larger compared to learning with an explicit feature vector representation. We also show that shallow syntax helps improve the results and that discourse relations can be partially beneficial.},

@article{Salvi2012,
abstract = {We address the problem of bootstrapping language acquisition for an artificial system similarly to what is observed in experiments with human infants. Our method works by associating meanings to words in manipulation tasks, as a robot interacts with objects and listens to verbal descriptions of the interactions. The model is based on an affordance network, i.e., a mapping between robot actions, robot perceptions, and the perceived effects of these actions upon objects. We extend the affordance model to incorporate spoken words, which allows us to ground the verbal symbols to the execution of actions and the perception of the environment. The model takes verbal descriptions of a task as the input and uses temporal co-occurrence to create links between speech utterances and the involved objects, actions, and effects. We show that the robot is able form useful word-to-meaning associations, even without considering grammatical structure in the learning process and in the presence of recognition errors. These word-to-meaning associations are embedded in the robot's own understanding of its actions. Thus, they can be directly used to instruct the robot to perform tasks and also allow to incorporate context in the speech recognition task. We believe that the encouraging results with our approach may afford robots with a capacity to acquire language descriptors in their operation's environment as well as to shed some light as to how this challenging process develops with human infants.},

@inproceedings{Sauppe2014a,
abstract = {As robots collaborate with humans in increasingly diverse environments, they will need to effectively refer to objects of joint interest and adapt their references to various physical, environmental, and task conditions. Humans use a broad range of deictic gestures-gestures that direct attention to collocated objects, persons, or spaces-that include pointing, touching, and exhibiting to help their listeners understand their references. These gestures offer varying levels of support under different conditions, making some gestures more or less suitable for different settings. While these gestures offer a rich space for designing communicative behaviors for robots, a better understanding of how different deictic gestures affect communication under different conditions is critical for achieving effective human-robot interaction. In this paper, we seek to build such an understanding by implementing six deictic gestures on a humanlike robot and evaluating their communicative effectiveness in six diverse settings that represent physical, environmental, and task conditions under which robots are expected to employ deictic communication. Our results show that gestures which come into physical contact with the object offer the highest overall communicative accuracy and that specific settings benefit from the use of particular types of gestures. Our results highlight the rich design space for deictic gestures and inform how robots might adapt their gestures to the specific physical, environmental, and task conditions.},

@article{Schlesewsky2004,
abstract = {One of the most basic assumptions regarding language comprehension is that it proceeds incrementally, i.e. by seeking to maximise the degree of interpretation computed with each new word that is encountered. This perspective has often been though to entail that the thematic interpretation of an argument may be derived from its grammatical function, for example, via a preference-strategy associating a subject with a Causer. In the present paper, we argue that these conclusions are not supported by experimental findings. Rather, as we show on the basis of a number of studies using event-related brain potentials (ERPs), the degree of meaning derived from a given sentence fragment (form) during online sentence comprehension differs as a function of the morphological informativeness of the sentential arguments. Finally, we present a new model of sentence comprehension, the Argument Dependency Model (ADM), which is designed to capture these differences in the way that meaning is computed incrementally. Specifically, the ADM assumes that argument processing proceeds via two alternative processing pathways, one of which is syntactic, and the other of which is thematic (interpretive) in nature. Whereas both pathways seek to establish hierarchical relations between arguments, only the thematic pathway allows for incremental interpretation to be maximised. Which of the two pathways is chosen during the comprehension of a given sentence crucially depends on the morphological informativeness (i.e. presence or absence of unambiguous morphological case marking) of the arguments. Consequences for language architecture arising from this model will be discussed. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All right Reserved.},

abstract = {Conducted 2 experiments that (1) examined the extent to which the learned perspective is maintained in memory; (2) examined a test comprehension issue, that of determinacy, as it applies to spatial descriptions; and (3) assessed the interaction between perspective and determinacy. In both experiments, college students received a spatial description relating a route through an environment. Descriptions differed in terms of the spatial perspective presented, either route or survey, and the degree to which spatial information was determined, either indeterminate, determinate, or overdeterminate. In Exp 1, 109 Ss read the description and in Exp 2, 65 Ss listened to the description and took notes for later use. Results indicate that perspective and determinacy influenced memory and the contents of participants' notes. Perspective influenced the integration of information. The effect of determinacy depended on degree. Indeterminacy influenced use of a mental representation, in particular during wayfinding. Overdeterminacy stressed working memory, thereby influencing many aspects of performance. Findings indicate that perspective and determinacy, which commonly vary in spatial descriptions, influence the ability to efficiently use descriptions. Descriptions are appended.

Experiments comparing the ID3 symbolic learning algorithm with the perceptron and backpropagation neural learning algorithms have been performed using five large, real-world data sets. Overall, backpropagation performs slightly better than the other two algorithms in terms of classification accuracy on new examples, but takes much longer to train. Experimental results suggest that backpropagation can work significantly better on data sets containing numerical data. Also analyzed empirically are the effects of (1) the amount of training data, (2) imperfect training examples, and (3) the encoding of the desired outputs. Backpropagation occasionally outperforms the other two systems when given relatively small amounts of training data. It is slightly more accurate than ID3 when examples are noisy or incompletely specified. Finally, backpropagation more effectively utilizes a distributed output},

Rather than focusing on identity assignment, we make inferring attributes the core problem of recognition. These attributes can be semantic (ldquospottyrdquo) or discriminative (ldquodogs have it but sheep do notrdquo). Learning attributes presents a major new challenge: generalization across object categories, not just across instances within a category. In this paper, we also introduce a novel feature selection method for learning attributes that generalize well across categories. We support our claims by thorough evaluation that provides insights into the limitations of the standard recognition paradigm of naming and demonstrates the new abilities provided by our attribute-based framework.},

In order to elicit error handling strategies, a speech recogniser was used to corrupt the speech in one direction. This way, data could be collected on how the subjects might recover from speech recognition errors. This method for studying error handling has the advantages that the level of understanding is transparent to the analyser, and the errors that occur are similar to errors in spoken dialogue systems. The results show that when subjects face speech recognition problems, a common strategy is to ask task-related questions that confirm their hypothesis about the situation instead of signalling non-understanding. Compared to other strategies, such as asking for a repetition, this strategy leads to better understanding of subsequent utterances, whereas signalling non-understanding leads to decreased experience of task success. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Recursive structure is commonly found in the inputs of different modalities such as natural scene images or natural language sentences. Discovering this recursive structure helps us to not only identify the units that an image or sentence contains but also how they interact to form a whole. We introduce a max-margin structure prediction architecture based on recursive neural networks that can successfully recover such structure both in complex scene images as well as sentences. The same algorithm can be used both to provide a competitive syntactic parser for natural language sentences from the Penn Treebank and to outperform alternative approaches for semantic scene segmentation, annotation and classification. For segmentation and annotation our algorithm obtains a new level of state-of-the-art performance on the Stanford background dataset (78.1{\%}). The features from the image parse tree outperform Gist descriptors for scene classification by 4{\%}.},

abstract = {Previous work on Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs) shows that these models can produce compositional feature vectors for accurately representing and classifying sentences or images. However, the sentence vectors of previous models cannot accurately represent visually grounded meaning. We introduce the DT-RNN model which uses dependency trees to embed sentences into a vector space in order to retrieve images that are described by those sentences. Unlike previous RNN-based models which use constituency trees, DT-RNNs naturally focus on the action and agents in a sentence. They are better able to abstract from the details of word order and syntactic expression. DT-RNNs outperform other recursive and recurrent neural networks, kernelized CCA and a bag-of-words baseline on the tasks of finding an image that fits a sentence description and vice versa. They also give more similar representations to sentences that describe the same image.},

@article{Spivey_2002tw,
abstract = {When participants follow spoken instructions to pick up and move objects in a visual workspace, their eye movements to the objects are closely time-locked to referential expressions in the instructions. Two experiments used this methodology to investigate the processing of the temporary ambiguities that arise because spoken language unfolds over time. Experiment 1 examined the processing of sentences with a temporarily ambiguous prepositional phrase (e.g., "Put the apple on the towel in the box") using visual contexts that supported either the normally preferred initial interpretation (the apple should be put on the towel) or the less-preferred interpretation (the apple is already on the towel and should be put in the box). Eye movement patterns clearly established that the initial interpretation of the ambiguous phrase was the one consistent with the context. Experiment 2 replicated these results using prerecorded digitized speech to eliminate any possibility of prosodic differences across conditions or experimenter demand. Overall, the findings are consistent with a broad theoretical framework in which real-time language comprehension immediately takes into account a rich array of relevant nonlinguistic context. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

@book{Steedman2000,
abstract = {In this book Mark Steedman argues that the surface syntax of natural languages maps spoken and written forms directly to a compositional semantic representation that includes predicate-argument structure, quantification, and information structure without constructing any intervening structural representation. His purpose is to construct a principled theory of natural grammar that is directly compatible with both explanatory linguistic accounts of a number of problematic syntactic phenomena and a straightforward computational account of the way sentences are mapped onto representations of meaning. The radical nature of Steedman's proposal stems from his claim that much of the apparent complexity of syntax, prosody, and processing follows from the lexical specification of the grammar and from the involvement of a small number of universal rule-types for combining predicates and arguments. These syntactic operations are related to the combinators of Combinatory Logic, engendering a much freer definition of derivational constituency than is traditionally assumed. This property allows Combinatory Categorial Grammar to capture elegantly the structure and interpretation of coordination and intonation contour in English as well as some well-known interactions between word order, coordination, and relativization across a number of other languages. It also allows more direct compatibility with incremental semantic interpretation during parsing.The book covers topics in formal linguistics, intonational phonology, computational linguistics, and experimental psycholinguistics, presenting them as an integrated theory of the language faculty in a form accessible to readers from any of those fields.},

The models are inspired by the main approaches to human categorisation being discussed in the literature: nativism, empiricism, and culturalism. Colour is taken as a case study. Although we take no stance on which position is to be accepted as final truth with respect to human categorisation and naming, we do point to theoretical constraints that make each position more or less likely and we make clear suggestions on what the best engineering solution would be. Specifically, we argue that the collective choice of a shared repertoire must integrate multiple constraints, including constraints coming from communication.},

Most researchers a priori select a given CSM, and proceed to use the selected model for color segmentation of the face by constructing a color distribution model (CDM). There is limited work on finding the overall best CSM. We develop a procedure to adaptively change the CSM throughout the processing of a video. We show that this works in environments where the face moves through multi-positioned light sources with varying types of illumination. A test of the procedure using the 2D color space models; RG, rg, HS, YQ and CbCr found that switching between the color spaces resulted in increased tracking performance. In addition, we have proposed a new performance measure for evaluating color-tracking algorithms, which include both accuracy and robustness of the tracking window. The methodology developed can be used to find the optimal CSM-CDM combination in adaptive color tracking systems.},

abstract = {We describe a statistical approach for modeling dialogue acts in conversational speech, i.e., speech-act-like units such as STATEMENT, Question, BACKCHANNEL, Agreement, Disagreement, and Apology. Our model detects and predicts dialogue acts based on lexical, collocational, and prosodic cues, as well as on the discourse coherence of the dialogue act sequence. The dialogue model is based on treating the discourse structure of a conversation as a hidden Markov model and the individual dialogue acts as observations emanating from the model states. Constraints on the likely sequence of dialogue acts are modeled via a dialogue act n-gram. The statistical dialogue grammar is combined with word n-grams, decision trees, and neural networks modeling the idiosyncratic lexical and prosodic manifestations of each dialogue act. We develop a probabilistic integration of speech recognition with dialogue modeling, to improve both speech recognition and dialogue act classification accuracy. Models are trained and evaluated using a large hand-labeled database of 1,155 conversations from the Switchboard corpus of spontaneous human-to-human telephone speech. We achieved good dialogue act labeling accuracy (65{\%} based on errorful, automatically recognized words and prosody, and 71{\%} based on word transcripts, compared to a chance baseline accuracy of 35{\%} and human accuracy of 84{\%}) and a small reduction in word recognition error.},

The authors found that these conversations impaired driver's reactions to vehicles braking in front of them. The authors assessed whether this impairment could be attributed to a withdrawal of attention from the visual scene, yielding a form of inattention blindness. Cell phone conversations impaired explicit recognition memory for roadside billboards. Eye-tracking data indicated that this was due to reduced attention to foveal information. This interpretation was bolstered by data showing that cell phone conversations impaired implicit perceptual memory for items presented at fixation. The data suggest that the impairment of driving performance produced by cell phone conversations is mediated, at least in part, by reduced attention to visual inputs.},

abstract = {Over the last years, the robotics community has made substantial progress in detection and 3D pose estimation of known and unknown objects. However, the question of how to identify objects based on language descriptions has not been investigated in detail. While the computer vision community recently started to investigate the use of attributes for object recognition, these approaches do not consider the task settings typically observed in robotics, where a combination of appearance attributes and object names might be used in referral language to identify specific objects in a scene. In this paper, we introduce an approach for identifying objects based on natural language containing appearance and name attributes. To learn rich RGB-D features needed for attribute classification, we extend recently introduced sparse coding techniques so as to automatically learn attribute-dependent features. We introduce a large data set of attribute descriptions of objects in the RGB-D object dataset. Experiments on this data set demonstrate the strong performance of our approach to language based object identification. We also show that our attribute-dependent features provide significantly better generalization to previously unseen attribute values, thereby enabling more rapid learning of new attribute values.},

The challenge is to develop a system that is low-cost, reliable in unstructured home settings, and also straightforward to use. In this paper, we use a RGBD sensor (Microsoft Kinect) as the input sensor, and present learning algorithms to infer the activities. Our algorithm is based on a hierarchical maximum entropy Markov model (MEMM). It considers a person's activity as composed of a set of sub-activities, and infers the two-layered graph structure using a dynamic programming approach. We test our algorithm on detecting and recognizing twelve different activities performed by four people in different environments, such as a kitchen, a living room, an office, etc., and achieve an average performance of 84.3{\%} when the person was seen before in the training set (and 64.2{\%} when the person was not seen before).},

abstract = {Two border following algorithms are proposed for the topological analysis of digitized binary images. The first one determines the surroundness relations among the borders of a binary image. Since the outer borders and the hole borders have a one-to-one correspondence to the connected components of 1-pixels and to the holes, respectively, the proposed algorithm yields a representation of a binary image, from which one can extract some sort of features without reconstructing the image. The second algorithm, which is a modified version of the first, follows only the outermost borders (i.e., the outer borders which are not surrounded by holes). These algorithms can be effectively used in component counting, shrinking, and topological structural analysis of binary images, when a sequential digital computer is used. ?? 1985.},

A spatial routine is a script composed from a set of primitive operations on sensor data, analogous to Ullman's visual routines. We hypothesize that a set of primitives that underlie spatial language could be used to succinctly express themeaning of spatial terms in away that can be used to inter- pret natural language commands. This hypothesis is tested by using spatial routines to build a natural language interface to a real-time strategy game, in which a player controls an army of units in a battle. Spatial routines are used as a top down controlmechanismfor the system, providing amapping from natural language commands to system behavior. Although the current implementation has significant limitations as re- vealed in an initial evaluation, we believe that the concept of spatial routines holds promise as a way to ground spatial language semantics in terms of embodied sensory-motor in- teraction.},

@article{Thomson2010,
abstract = {This paper describes a statistically motivated framework for performing real-time dialogue state updates and policy learning in a spoken dialogue system. The framework is based on the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which provides a well-founded, statistical model of spoken dialogue management. However, exact belief state updates in a POMDP model are computationally intractable so approximate methods must be used. This paper presents a tractable method based on the loopy belief propagation algorithm. Various simplifications are made, which improve the efficiency significantly compared to the original algorithm as well as compared to other POMDP-based dialogue state updating approaches. A second contribution of this paper is a method for learning in spoken dialogue systems which uses a component-based policy with the episodic Natural Actor Critic algorithm. The framework proposed in this paper was tested on both simulations and in a user trial. Both indicated that using Bayesian updates of the dialogue state significantly outperforms traditional definitions of the dialogue state. Policy learning worked effectively and the learned policy outperformed all others on simulations. In user trials the learned policy was also competitive, although its optimality was less conclusive. Overall, the Bayesian update of dialogue state framework was shown to be a feasible and effective approach to building real-world POMDP-based dialogue systems. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We use hierarchical Pitman- Yor processes to model statistical dependencies between meaning representations of predicates and those of their arguments, as well as the clusters of their syntactic realizations. We develop a modification of the Metropolis- Hastings split-merge sampler, resulting in an efficient inference algorithm for the model.

abstract = {We introduce the information state approach to dialog mangement and show how it can be used to formalize theories of dialog in a manner suitable for easy implementation. We also show how this approach can lead to better engineering of dialog management components of dialog systems, allowing for separate development of modular system fundamentals, dialog theories, and domain-specific dialogue systems, in a manner where components can more easily be reused. TrindiKit is a tool instantiating the lowest level, and allowing straightforward implementation of dialog theories formalized using the information state approach. We briefly describe several dialog systems built using TrindiKit, and how components have been successfully further developed and reused in other projects.},

abstract = {Cognitive linguistics has reached a stage of maturity where many researchers are looking for an explicit formal grounding of their work. Unfortunately, most current models of deep language processing incorporate assumptions from generative grammar that are at odds with the cognitive movement in linguistics. This demonstration shows how Fluid Construction Grammar (FCG), a fully operational and bidirectional uniﬁcation-based grammar formalism, caters for this increasing demand. FCG features many of the tools that were pioneered in computational linguistics in the 70s-90s, but combines them in an innovative way. This demonstration highlights the main differences between FCG and related formalisms.},

abstract = {Recently, an ensemble speaker and speaking environment modeling (ESSEM) framework was proposed to enhance automatic speech recognition performance under adverse conditions. In the online phase of ESSEM, the prepared environment structure in the offline stage is transformed to a set of acoustic models for the target testing environment by using a mapping function. In the original ESSEM framework, the mapping function parameters are estimated based on a maximum likelihood (ML) criterion. In this study, we propose to use a maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion to calculate the mapping function to avoid a possible over-fitting problem that can degrade the accuracy of environment characterization. For the MAP estimation, we also study two types of prior densities, namely, clustered prior and hierarchical prior, in this paper. On the Aurora-2 task using either type of prior densities, MAP-based ESSEM can achieve better performance than ML-based ESSEM, especially under low SNR conditions. When comparing to our best baseline results, the MAP-based ESSEM achieves a 14.97{\%} (5.41{\%} to 4.60{\%}) word error rate reduction in average at a signal to noise ratio of 0 dB to 20 dB over the three testing sets.},

DCNs are shown to have several advantages over deep belief networks (DBNs) including classification accuracy and training scalability. However, adoption of DCNs for SUC comes with non-trivial issues. Specifically, SUC has an extremely sparse input feature space encompassing a very large number of lexical and semantic features. This is about a few thousand times larger than the feature space for acoustic modeling, yet with a much smaller number of training samples. Experimental results we obtained on a domain classification task for spoken language understanding demonstrate the effectiveness of DCNs. The DCN-based method produces higher SUC accuracy than the Boosting-based discriminative classifier with word trigrams.},

abstract = {One of the main data resources used in many studies over the past two decades for spoken language understanding (SLU) research in spoken dialog systems is the airline travel information system (ATIS) corpus. Two primary tasks in SLU are intent determination (ID) and slot filling (SF). Recent studies reported error rates below 5{\%} for both of these tasks employing discriminative machine learning techniques with the ATIS test set. While these low error rates may suggest that this task is close to being solved, further analysis reveals the continued utility of ATIS as a research corpus. In this paper, our goal is not experimenting with domain specific techniques or features which can help with the remaining SLU errors, but instead exploring methods to realize this utility via extensive error analysis. We conclude that even with such low error rates, ATIS test set still includes many unseen example categories and sequences, hence requires more data. Better yet, new annotated larger data sets from more complex tasks with realistic utterances can avoid over-tuning in terms of modeling and feature design. We believe that advancements in SLU can be achieved by having more naturally spoken data sets and employing more linguistically motivated features while preserving robustness due to speech recognition noise and variance due to natural language.},

This research is motivated by the observation that, while current statistical SLU models usually perform accurately for simple, well-formed sentences, error rates increase for more complex, longer, more natural or spontaneous utterances. Furthermore, users familiar with web search usually formulate their information requests as a keyword search query, suggesting that frameworks which can handle both forms of inputs is required. We propose a dependency parsing-based sentence simplification approach that extracts a set of keywords from natural language sentences and uses those in addition to entire utterances for completing SLU tasks. We evaluated this approach using the well-studied ATIS corpus with manual and automatic transcriptions and observed significant error reductions for both intent determination (30{\%} relative) and slot filling (15{\%} relative) tasks over the state-of-the-art performances.},

abstract = {Computers understand very little of the meaning of human language. This profoundly limits our ability to give instructions to computers, the ability of computers to explain their actions to us, and the ability of computers to analyse and process text. Vector space models (VSMs) of semantics are beginning to address these limits. This paper surveys the use of VSMs for semantic processing of text. We organize the literature on VSMs according to the structure of the matrix in a VSM. There are currently three broad classes of VSMs, based on term-document, word-context, and pair-pattern matrices, yielding three classes of applications. We survey a broad range of applications in these three categories and we take a detailed look at a specific open source project in each category. Our goal in this survey is to show the breadth of applications of VSMs for semantics, to provide a new perspective on VSMs for those who are already familiar with the area, and to provide pointers into the literature for those who are less familiar with the field.},

abstract = {The present paper presents an anaphoric account of presupposition. It is argued that presuppositional expressions should not be seen as referring expressions, nor is presupposition to be explicated in terms of some non-standard logic. The notion of presupposition should not be relegated to a pragmatic theory either. Instead presuppositional expressions are claimed to be anaphoric expressions which have internal structure and semantic content. In fact they only differ from pronouns and other semantically less loaded anaphors in that they have more descriptive content. It is this fact which enables them to create an antecedent in case discourse does not provide one. If their capacity to accommodate is taken into account they can be treated by basically the same mechanism which handles the resolution of pronouns. The theory is elaborated in the framework of discourse representation theory. It is shown that pragmatic factors interfere in the resolution of presuppositional anaphors. The resulting account can neither be classified as wholly semantic nor wholly pragmatic. Section 1 presents a survey of standing problems in the theory of presupposition projection and discusses the major competing approaches. An argumentation for a purely anaphoric account of presupposition is given in section 2. Section 3 presents a coding of presuppositional expressions in an extension of discourse representation theory. The final section is devoted to a discussion of the constraints which govern the resolution of presuppositional anaphors.},

abstract = {One challenge of implementing spoken dialogue systems for long-term interaction is how to adapt the dialogue as user and system become more familiar. We believe this challenge includes evoking and signaling aspects of long-term relationships such as rapport. For tutoring systems, this may additionally require knowing how relationships are signaled among non-adult users. We therefore investigate conversational strategies used by teenagers in peer tutoring dialogues, and how these strategies function differently among friends or strangers. In particular, we use annotated and automatically extracted linguistic devices to predict impoliteness and positivity in the next turn. To take into account the sparse nature of these features in real data we use models including Lasso, ridge estimator, and elastic net. We evaluate the predictive power of our models under various settings, and compare our sparse models with standard non-sparse solutions. Our experiments demonstrate that our models are more accurate than non-sparse models quantitatively, and that teens use unexpected kinds of language to do relationship work such as signaling rapport, but friends and strangers, tutors and tutees, carry out this work in quite different ways from one another.},

With this idea as inspiration, we examine a number of prosodic and timing features as potential sources of information on what words the speaker is likely to say next. In spontaneous dialog we find that word probabilities do vary with such features. Using perplexity as the metric, the most informative of these included recent speaking rate, volume, and pitch, and time until end of utterance. Using simple combinations of such features to augment trigram language models gave up to a 8.4{\%} perplexity benefit on the Switchboard corpus, and up to a 1.0{\%} relative reduction in word error rate (0.3{\%} absolute) on the Verbmobil II corpus. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We have been developing a spoken language system to recognize and understand spontaneous speech. It is difficult for such systems to achieve good coverage of the lexicon and grammar that subjects might use because spontaneous speech often contains disfluencies and ungrammatical constructions. Our goal is to respond appropriately to input, even though coverage is not complete. The natural language component of our system is oriented toward the extraction of information relevant to a task, and seeks to directly optimize the correctness of the extracted information (and therefore the system response). We use a flexible frame-based parser, which parses as much of the input as possible. This approach leads both to high accuracy and robustness. We have implemented a version of this system for the Air Travel Information Service (ATIS) task, which is being used by several ARPA-funded sites to develop and evaluate speech understanding systems. Users are asked to perform a task that requires getting information from an Air Travel database. In this paper, we describe recent improvements in our system resulting from our efforts to improve the coverage given a limited amount of training data. These improvements address a number of problems including generating an adequate lexicon and grammar for the recognizer, generating and generalizing an appropriate grammar for the parser, and dealing with ambiguous parses.},

abstract = {An important component of human-robot interaction is that people need to be able to instruct robots to move to other locations using naturally given directions. When giving directions, people often make mistakes such as labelling errors (e.g., left vs. right) and errors of omission (skipping important decision points in a sequence). Furthermore, people often use multiple levels of granularity in specifying directions, referring to locations using single object landmarks, multiple landmarks in a given location, or identifying large regions as a single location. The challenge is to identify the correct path to a destination from a sequence of noisy, possibly erroneous directions. In our work we cast this problem as probabilistic inference: given a set of directions, an agent should automatically find the path with the geometry and physical appearance to maximize the likelihood of those directions. We use a specific variant of a Markov Random Field (MRF) to represent our model, and gather multi-granularity representation information using existing large tagged datasets. On a dataset of route directions collected in a large third floor university building, we found that our algorithm correctly inferred the true final destination in 47 out of the 55 cases successfully followed by humans volunteers. These results suggest that our algorithm is performing well relative to human users. In the future this work will be included in a broader system for autonomously constructing environmental representations that support natural human-robot interaction for direction giving.},

abstract = {Proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of rice shoot and root tonoplast-enriched and plasma membrane-enriched membrane fractions were carried out to look at tissue-specific expression, and to identify putative regulatory sites of membrane transport proteins. Around 90 unique membrane proteins were identified, which included primary and secondary transporters, ion channels and aquaporins. Primary H(+) pumps from the AHA family showed little isoform specificity in their tissue expression pattern, whereas specific isoforms of the Ca(2+) pump ECA/ACA family were expressed in root and shoot tissues. Several ABC transporters were detected, particularly from the MDR and PDR subfamilies, which often showed expression in either roots or shoots. Ammonium transporters were expressed in root, but not shoot, tissue. Large numbers of sugar transporters were expressed, particularly in green tissue. The occurrence of phosphorylation sites in rice transporters such as AMT1;1 and PIP2;6 agrees with those previously described in other species, pointing to conserved regulatory mechanisms. New phosphosites were found in many transporters, including H(+) pumps and H(+):cation antiporters, often at residues that are well conserved across gene families. Comparison of root and shoot tissue showed that phosphorylation of AMT1;1 and several further transporters may be tissue dependent.},

abstract = {The benefit of tracking a probability distribution over mul-tiple dialogue states has been demonstrated in the literature. However, the dialogue state in past work has been limited to a small number of variables, and growing the number of vari-ables in the dialogue state prevents the probability distribution from being updated in real-time. This paper shows how the number of variables composing the dialogue state can be in-creased while maintaining response times suitable for a spo-ken dialogue system. Rather than performing exact inference using the joint distribution over all variables, a particle filter is employed to compute an approximate update. Dialogue states (particles) are sampled, weighted by their agreement with the speech recognition results, and marginalized to produce a new distribution over each variable. Results on a spoken dialogue system for troubleshooting show that a relatively small num-ber of particles are required to achieve performance close to an exact update, enabling the dialogue system to run in real-time.},

Rapidly adding intents is one of the main bottlenecks to scaling—adding functionality to—personal assistants. In this paper we show how interactive learning can be applied to the creation of statistical intent mod- els. Interactive learning [10] combines model definition, labeling, model building, active learning, model evaluation, and feature engineering in a way that allows a domain expert—who need not be a machine learning expert—to build classifiers. We apply interactive learning to build a handful of intent models in three different domains. In controlled lab experiments, we show that intent detectors can be built using interactive learning, and then improved in a novel end-to-end visualization tool.We then applied this method to a publicly deployed personal assistant—Mi- crosoft Cortana — where a non-machine learning expert built an intent model in just over two hours, yielding excellent performance in the commercial service.},

abstract = {In a spoken dialog system, determining which action a machine should take in a given situation is a difficult problem because automatic speech recognition is unreliable and hence the state of the conversation can never be known with certainty. Much of the research in spoken dialog systems centres on mitigating this uncertainty and recent work has focussed on three largely disparate techniques: parallel dialog state hypotheses, local use of confidence scores, and automated planning. While in isolation each of these approaches can improve action selection, taken together they currently lack a unified statistical framework that admits global optimization. In this paper we cast a spoken dialog system as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We show how this formulation unifies and extends existing techniques to form a single principled framework. A number of illustrations are used to show qualitatively the potential benefits of POMDPs compared to existing techniques, and empirical results from dialog simulations are presented which demonstrate significant quantitative gains. Finally, some of the key challenges to advancing this method - in particular scalability - are briefly outlined. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A semantic parser is learned given a set of sentences anno- tated with their correct meaning represen- tations. The main innovation of WASP is its use of state-of-the-art statistical ma- chine translation techniques. A word alignment model is used for lexical acqui- sition, and the parsing model itself can be seen as a syntax-based translation model. We show that WASP performs favorably in terms of both accuracy and coverage compared to existing learning methods re- quiring similar amount of supervision, and shows better robustness to variations in task complexity and word order. 1},

Compounds which are not well modeled by the learned semantic composition function are considered non- compositional. We explore a range of dis- tributional vector-space models for seman- tic composition, empirically evaluate these models, and propose additional methods which improve results further. We show that a complex function such as polyno- mial projection can learn semantic compo- sition and identify non-compositionality in an unsupervised way, beating all other baselines ranging from simple to complex. We showthat enforcing sparsity is a useful regularizer in learning complex composi- tion functions. We show further improve- ments by training a decomposition func- tion in addition to the composition func- tion. Finally, we propose an EM algo- rithm over latent compositionality annota- tions that also improves the performance.},

@article{Yang2011,
abstract = {In this article we focus on human-human multi-tasking dialogues, in which pairs of conversants, using speech, work on an ongoing task while occasionally completing real-time tasks. The ongoing task is a poker game in which conversants need to assemble a poker hand, and the real-time task is a picture game in which conversants need to find out whether they have a certain picture on their displays. We employ empirical corpus studies and machine learning experiments to understand the mechanisms that people use in managing these complex interactions. First, we examine task interruptions: switching from the ongoing task to a real-time task. We find that generally conversants tend to interrupt at a less disruptive context in the ongoing task when possible. We also find that the discourse markers oh and wait occur in initiating a task interruption twice as often as in the conversation of the ongoing task. Pitch is also found to be statistically correlated with task interruptions; in fact, the more disruptive the task interruption, the higher the pitch. Second, we examine task resumptions: returning to the ongoing task after completing an interrupting real-time task. We find that conversants might simply resume the conversation where they left off, but sometimes they repeat the last utterance or summarize the critical information that was exchanged before the interruption. Third, we apply machine learning to determine how well task interruptions can be recognized automatically and to investigate the usefulness of the cues that we find in the corpus studies. We find that discourse context, pitch, and the discourse markers oh and wait are important features to reliably recognize task interruptions; and with non-lexical features one can improve the performance of recognizing task interruptions with more than a 50{\%} relative error reduction over a baseline. Finally, we discuss the implication of our findings for building a speech interface that supports multi-tasking dialogue. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

By including an explicit Bayesian model of uncertainty and by optimizing the policy via a reward-driven process, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide such a framework. However, exact model representation and optimization is computationally intractable. Hence, the practical application of POMDP-based systems requires efficient algorithms and carefully constructed approximations.

It is based on a spatial knowledge base encompassing both robot- and human-centric representations. Existing algorithms for the generation of referring expres- sions (GRE) try to find a description that uniquely identifies the referent with respect to other enti- ties that are in the current context. Mobile robots, however, act in large-scale space, that is, environ- ments that are larger than what can be perceived at a glance, e.g., an office building with different floors, each containing several rooms and objects. One challenge when referring to elsewhere is thus to in- clude enough information so that the interlocutors can extend their context appropriately. We address this challenge with a method for context construc- tion that can be used for both generating and resolv- ing REs – two previously disjoint aspects. Our ap- proach is embedded in a bi-directional framework for natural language processing for robots.},
