abstract = {We evaluate a wizard-of-oz spoken dialogue system that adapts to multiple user affective states in real-time: user disengagement and uncertainty. We compare this version with the prior version of our system, which only adapts to user uncertainty. Our analysis investigates how iteratively adding new affect adaptation to an existing affect-adaptive system impacts global and local performance. We find a sig- nificant increase in motivation for users who most frequently received the disengagement adaptation. Moreover, responding to disen- gagement breaks its negative correlations with task success and user satisfaction, reduces un- certainty levels, and reduces the likelihood of continued disengagement.},

This is accomplished by the collective actions of the current contributor and his or her partners, and these result in units of conversation called contributions.

A small post-hoc analysis further suggests that, when the model-generated AN vector is not similar to the corpus-observed AN vector, this is due to anomalies in the latter. We show more-over that our approach provides two novel ways to represent adjective meanings, alternative to its representation via corpus-based co-occurrence vectors, both outperforming the latter in an adjective clustering task.},

abstract = {Introduction: While sentence comprehension has been reported to be defective in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), it is still unclear if this disorder reflects the presence of syntactic impairment, or may be attributed to other factors, such as executive or working memory dysfunction. In order to assess the status of syntactic knowledge in a group of patients belonging to the FTD spectrum, we investigated their ability to detect violations of Universal Grammar principles in a sentence judgement task. Methods: The group included four semantic dementia patients (SD), nine frontal variant of FTD patients (FvFTD), 15 progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients, and 11 corticobasal degeneration syndrome (CBDS) patients. Their performance was compared to a group of 10 patients with mild probable Alzheimer disease (AD) and to 10 healthy volunteers. The patients underwent a standard aphasia test and a sentence comprehension test. The experimental study included five kinds of violations: semantic coherence (SC), verb-subject agreement (VSAgr), pronominalization involving clitic movement (ClM), interrogatives (WhS) and contrastive focus constructions (CFC). Results: The FTD patients performed within normal range in the aphasia test, and in the sentence comprehension test. Within the FTD subgroups, only patients with CBDS were significantly impaired in detecting three of the five kinds of violations. AD patients were also impaired in the detection of WhS and SC anomalies and in sentence comprehension. Discussion: The present findings indicate that, within the FTD spectrum, an impairment of syntactic knowledge can be found only in CBDS patients, even in the absence of clinical evidence of aphasia. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We believe this challenge includes evoking and signaling aspects of long-term relationships such as rapport. For tutoring systems, this may additionally require knowing how relationships are signaled among non-adult users. We therefore investigate conversational strategies used by teenagers in peer tutoring dialogues, and how these strategies function differently among friends or strangers. In particular, we use annotated and automatically extracted linguistic devices to predict impoliteness and positivity in the next turn. To take into account the sparse nature of these features in real data we use models including Lasso, ridge estimator, and elastic net. We evaluate the predictive power of our models under various settings, and compare our sparse models with standard non-sparse solutions. Our experiments demonstrate that our models are more accurate than non-sparse models quantitatively, and that teens use unexpected kinds of language to do relationship work such as signaling rapport, but friends and strangers, tutors and tutees, carry out this work in quite different ways from one another.},

Parallel Distributed Processing describes their work in developing a theoretical framework for describing this parallel distributed processing activity and in applying the framework to the development of models of aspects of perception, memory, language, and thought. Volume 1 lays the theoretical foundations of parallel distributed processing. It introduces the approach and the reasons why the authors feel it is a fruitful one, describes several models of basic mechanisms with wide applicability to different problems, and presents a number of specific technical analyses of different aspects of parallel distributed models.},

abstract = {There are many references that concern a specific aspect of speaker tracking. This paper focuses on the speaker modeling issue and proposes conditional random fields (CRF) for this purpose. CRF is a class of undirected graphical models for classifying sequential data. CRF has some interesting characteristics which have encouraged us to use this model in a speaker modeling and tracking task. The main concern of CRF model is its training. Known approaches for CRF training are prone to overfitting and unreliable convergence. To solve this problem, variational approaches are proposed in this paper. The main novelty of this paper is to adapt variational framework for CRF training. The resulted approach is evaluated on three different areas. First, the best CRF model configuration for speaker modeling is evaluated on text independent speaker verification. Next, the selected model is used in a speaker detection task, in which the models of the existing speakers in the conversation are known a priori. Then, the proposed CRF approach is compared with GMM in an online speaker tracking framework. The results show that the proposed CRF model is superior to GMM in speaker detection and tracking, due to its capability for sequence modeling and segmentation. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We propose a system for human-robot interaction that learns both models for spatial prepositions and for object recognition. Our system grounds the meaning of an input sentence in terms of visual percepts coming from the robot's sensors in order to send an appropriate command to the PR2 or respond to spatial queries. To perform this grounding, the system recognizes the objects in the scene, determines which spatial relations hold between those objects, and semantically parses the input sentence. The proposed system uses the visual and spatial information in conjunction with the semantic parse to interpret statements that refer to objects (nouns), their spatial relationships (prepositions), and to execute commands (actions). The semantic parse is inherently compositional, allowing the robot to understand complex commands that refer to multiple objects and relations such as: “Move the cup close to the robot to the area in front of the plate and behind the tea box”. Our system correctly parses 94\% of the 210 online test sentences, correctly interprets 91\% of the correctly parsed sentences, and correctly executes 89\% of the correctly interpreted sentences.},

abstract = {In visual search, detection of a target is faster when a layout of nontarget items is repeatedly encountered, suggesting that contextual invariances can guide attention. Moreover, contextual cueing can also adapt to environmental changes. For instance, when the target undergoes a predictable (i.e., learnable) location change, then contextual cueing remains effective even after the change, suggesting that a learned context is ?remapped? and adjusted to novel requirements. Here, we explored the stability of contextual remapping: Four experiments demonstrated that target location changes are only effectively remapped when both the initial and the future target positions remain predictable across the entire experiment. Otherwise, contextual remapping fails. In sum, this pattern of results suggests that multiple, predictable target locations can be associated with a given repeated context, allowing the flexible adaptation of previously learned contingencies to novel task demands.},

Recent statistical approaches to this problem require additional resources (e.g. gazetteers, grammars, syntactic treebanks) which are expensive and time-consuming to produce and maintain. However, simple datasets annotated only with slot-values are commonly used in dialogue systems development, and are easy to collect, automatically annotate, and update. We show that it is possible to reach state-of-the-art performance using minimal additional resources, by using Markov logic networks (MLNs). We also show that performance can be further improved by exploiting long distance dependencies between slot-values. For example, by representing such features in MLNs, but without using a gazetteer, we outperform the hidden vector state (HVS) model of He and Young 2006 (1.26\% improvement, a 13\% error reduction).},

Previous approaches have been designed for particular natural languages or specific meaning representations; here we present a more general method. The approach induces a probabilistic CCG grammar that represents the meaning of individual words and defines how these meanings can be combined to analyze complete sentences. We use higher-order unification to define a hypothesis space containing all grammars consistent with the training data, and develop an online learning algorithm that efficiently searches this space while simultaneously es- timating the parameters of a log-linear parsing model. Experiments demonstrate high accuracy on benchmark data sets in four languages with two different meaning representations. 1},

The second algorithm, which is a modified version of the first, follows only the outermost borders (i.e., the outer borders which are not surrounded by holes). These algorithms can be effectively used in component counting, shrinking, and topological structural analysis of binary images, when a sequential digital computer is used},

The similarity between speakers' initial eye movements and those of observers performing a nonverbal event-comprehension task suggested that response-relevant information was rapidly extracted from scenes, allowing speakers to select grammatical subjects based on comprehended events rather than salience. When speaking extemporaneously, speakers began fixating pictured elements less than a second before naming them within their descriptions, a finding consistent with incremental lexical encoding. Eye movements anticipated the order of mention despite changes in picture orientation, in who-did-what-to-whom, and in sentence structure. The results support Wundt's theory of sentence production.},

An interface allowing the user to access and modify intermediate processing steps without the need for a technical understanding of the system is described, along with examples of how this interface can be put to use in research, development and teaching. The usefulness of the modular and transparent design approach is further illustrated with an early prototype of an interface for emotional speech synthesis},

Graphical models are a flexible, concise, and expressive probabilistic modeling framework with which one may rapidly specify a vast collection of statistical models. This paper begins with a brief description of the representational and computational aspects of the framework. Following that is a detailed description of GMTK's features, including a language for specifying structures and probability distributions, logarithmic space exact training and decoding procedures, the concept of switching parents, and a generalized EM training method which allows arbitrary sub-Gaussian parameter tying. Taken together, these features endow GMTK with a degree of expressiveness and functionality that significantly complements other publically available packages. GMTK was recently used in the 2001 Johns Hopkins Summer Workshop, and experimental results are described in detail both herein and in a companion paper.},

abstract = {In a spoken dialog system, determining which action a machine should take in a given situation is a difficult problem because automatic speech recognition is unreliable and hence the state of the conversation can never be known with certainty. Much of the research in spoken dialog systems centres on mitigating this uncertainty and recent work has focussed on three largely disparate techniques: parallel dialog state hypotheses, local use of confidence scores, and automated planning. While in isolation each of these approaches can improve action selection, taken together they currently lack a unified statistical framework that admits global optimization. In this paper we cast a spoken dialog system as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We show how this formulation unifies and extends existing techniques to form a single principled framework. A number of illustrations are used to show qualitatively the potential benefits of POMDPs compared to existing techniques, and empirical results from dialog simulations are presented which demonstrate significant quantitative gains. Finally, some of the key challenges to advancing this method - in particular scalability - are briefly outlined. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Previous approaches have been designed for particular natural languages or specific meaning representations; here we present a more general method. The approach induces a probabilistic CCG grammar that represents the meaning of individual words and defines how these meanings can be combined to analyze complete sentences. We use higher-order unification to define a hypothesis space containing all grammars consistent with the training data, and develop an online learning algorithm that efficiently searches this space while simultaneously es- timating the parameters of a log-linear parsing model. Experiments demonstrate high accuracy on benchmark data sets in four languages with two different meaning representations. 1},

Distributional models have been successful in modelling the meanings of content words, but logical semantics is necessary to adequately represent many function words. We follow formal semantics in mapping language to logical representations, but differ in that the relational constants used are induced by offline distributional clustering at the level of predicate- argument structure. Our clustering algorithm is highly scalable, allowing us to run on corpora the size of Gigaword. Different senses of a word are disambiguated based on their induced types. We outperform a variety of existing approaches on a wide-coverage question answering task, and demonstrate the ability to make complex multi-sentence inferences involving quantifiers on the FraCaS suite.},

abstract = {Studies monitoring eye-movements in scenes containing entities have provided robust evidence for incremental reference resolution processes. This paper addresses the less studied question of whether depicted event scenes can affect processes of incremental thematic role-assignment. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants inspected agent-action-patient events while listening to German verb-second sentences with initial structural and role ambiguity. The experiments investigated the time course with which listeners could resolve this ambiguity by relating the verb to the depicted events. Such verb-mediated visual event information allowed early disambiguation on-line, as evidenced by anticipatory eye-movements to the appropriate agent/patient role filler. We replicated this finding while investigating the effects of intonation. Experiment 3 demonstrated that when the verb was sentence-final and thus did not establish early reference to the depicted events, linguistic cues alone enabled disambiguation before people encountered the verb. Our results reveal the on-line influence of depicted events on incremental thematic role-assignment and disambiguation of local structural and role ambiguity. In consequence, our findings require a notion of reference that includes actions and events in addition to entities (e.g. Semantics and Cognition, 1983), and argue for a theory of on-line sentence comprehension that exploits a rich inventory of semantic categories. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Vector-based models of word meaning have become increasingly popular in cognitive science. The appeal of these models lies in their ability to represent meaning simply by using distributional information under the assumption that words occurring within similar contexts are semantically similar. Despite their widespread use, vector-based models are typically directed at representing words in isolation, and methods for constructing representations for phrases or sentences have received little attention in the literature. This is in marked contrast to experimental evidence (e.g., in sentential priming) suggesting that semantic similarity is more complex than simply a relation between isolated words. This article proposes a framework for representing the meaning of word combinations in vector space. Central to our approach is vector composition, which we operationalize in terms of additive and multiplicative functions. Under this framework, we introduce a wide range of composition models that we evaluate empirically on a phrase similarity task.},

abstract = {One of the main data resources used in many studies over the past two decades for spoken language understanding (SLU) research in spoken dialog systems is the airline travel information system (ATIS) corpus. Two primary tasks in SLU are intent determination (ID) and slot filling (SF). Recent studies reported error rates below 5\% for both of these tasks employing discriminative machine learning techniques with the ATIS test set. While these low error rates may suggest that this task is close to being solved, further analysis reveals the continued utility of ATIS as a research corpus. In this paper, our goal is not experimenting with domain specific techniques or features which can help with the remaining SLU errors, but instead exploring methods to realize this utility via extensive error analysis. We conclude that even with such low error rates, ATIS test set still includes many unseen example categories and sequences, hence requires more data. Better yet, new annotated larger data sets from more complex tasks with realistic utterances can avoid over-tuning in terms of modeling and feature design. We believe that advancements in SLU can be achieved by having more naturally spoken data sets and employing more linguistically motivated features while preserving robustness due to speech recognition noise and variance due to natural language.},

The doctrine that the meaning of a term is a concept carried the implication that mean- ings are mental entities. Frege, however, rebelled against this "psy- chologism." Feeling that meanings are public property-that the same meaning can be "grasped" by more than one person and by persons at different times-he identified concepts (and hence "intensions" or meanings) with abstract entities rather than mental entities. However, "grasping" these abstract entities was still an individual psychological act. None of these philosophers doubted that understanding a word (knowing its intension) was just a matter of being in a certain psychological state (somewhat in the way in which knowing how to factor numbers in one's head is just a mat- ter of being in a certain very complex psychological state).},

abstract = {One of the first steps in building a spoken language understanding (SLU) module for dialogue systems is the extraction of flat concepts out of a given word sequence, usually provided by an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. In this paper, six different modeling approaches are investigated to tackle the task of concept tagging. These methods include classical, well-known generative and discriminative methods like Finite State Transducers (FSTs), Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMMs), or Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as well as techniques recently applied to natural language processing such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) or Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs). Following a detailed description of the models, experimental and comparative results are presented on three corpora in different languages and with different complexity. The French MEDIA corpus has already been exploited during an evaluation campaign and so a direct comparison with existing benchmarks is possible. Recently collected Italian and Polish corpora are used to test the robustness and portability of the modeling approaches. For all tasks, manual transcriptions as well as ASR inputs are considered. Additionally to single systems, methods for system combination are investigated. The best performing model on all tasks is based on conditional random fields. On the MEDIA evaluation corpus, a concept error rate of 12.6\% could be achieved. Here, additionally to attribute names, attribute values have been extracted using a combination of a rule-based and a statistical approach. Applying system combination using weighted ROVER with all six systems, the concept error rate (CER) drops to 12.0\%.},

Because it uses incremental speech recognition and prosodic analysis, the system can give rapid feedback as the user is speaking, with a very short latency of around 200ms. Because it uses incremental speech synthesis and self-monitoring, the system can react to feedback from the user as the system is speaking. A comparative evaluation shows that na\"{\i}ve users preferred this system over a non-incremental version, and that it was perceived as more human-like.},

abstract = {We address the problem of bootstrapping language acquisition for an artificial system similarly to what is observed in experiments with human infants. Our method works by associating meanings to words in manipulation tasks, as a robot interacts with objects and listens to verbal descriptions of the interactions. The model is based on an affordance network, i.e., a mapping between robot actions, robot perceptions, and the perceived effects of these actions upon objects. We extend the affordance model to incorporate spoken words, which allows us to ground the verbal symbols to the execution of actions and the perception of the environment. The model takes verbal descriptions of a task as the input and uses temporal co-occurrence to create links between speech utterances and the involved objects, actions, and effects. We show that the robot is able form useful word-to-meaning associations, even without considering grammatical structure in the learning process and in the presence of recognition errors. These word-to-meaning associations are embedded in the robot's own understanding of its actions. Thus, they can be directly used to instruct the robot to perform tasks and also allow to incorporate context in the speech recognition task. We believe that the encouraging results with our approach may afford robots with a capacity to acquire language descriptors in their operation's environment as well as to shed some light as to how this challenging process develops with human infants.},

abstract = {In conversation, speakers and addressees work together in the making of a definite reference. In the model we propose, the speaker initiates the process by presenting or inviting a noun phrase. Before going on to the next contribution, the participants, if necessary, repair, expand on, or replace the noun phrase in an iterative process until they reach a version they mutually accept. In doing so they try to minimize their joint effort. The preferred procedure is for the speaker to present a simple noun phrase and for the addressee to accept it by allowing the next contribution to begin. We describe a communication task in which pairs of people conversed about arranging complex figures and show how the proposed model accounts for many features of the references they produced. The model follows, we suggest, from the mutual responsibility that participants in conversation bear toward the understanding of each utterance. Au cours d' une conversation, les interlocuteurs travaillent ensemble pour construire une r\'{e}f\'{e}rence d\'{e}finie. Dans le mod\`{e}le propos\`{e}, le locuteur initie le processus en pr\'{e}sentant un syntagme nominal. Avant de passer \`{a} la contribution suivante, les participants, si cela est n\'{e}cessaire, corrigent, d\'{e}veloppent ou remplacent ce syntagme nominal au cours d'un processus it\'{e}ratif jusqu'a ce que soit atteinte une version que tout deux acceptent. En faisant cela ils essaient de minimiser l'effort conjoint. La procedure pr\'{e}f\'{e}r\'{e}e consiste pour le locuteur \`{a} pr\'{e}senter un syntagme nominal simple et pour l'allocuteur d'accepter ce syntagme en donnant le feu vert pour l'\'{e}change suivant.

Experiment 3 replicated the main findings from Experiment 1, regardless of whether or not the theme was the backward-looking center.

abstract = {As robots collaborate with humans in increasingly diverse environments, they will need to effectively refer to objects of joint interest and adapt their references to various physical, environmental, and task conditions. Humans use a broad range of deictic gestures-gestures that direct attention to collocated objects, persons, or spaces-that include pointing, touching, and exhibiting to help their listeners understand their references. These gestures offer varying levels of support under different conditions, making some gestures more or less suitable for different settings. While these gestures offer a rich space for designing communicative behaviors for robots, a better understanding of how different deictic gestures affect communication under different conditions is critical for achieving effective human-robot interaction. In this paper, we seek to build such an understanding by implementing six deictic gestures on a humanlike robot and evaluating their communicative effectiveness in six diverse settings that represent physical, environmental, and task conditions under which robots are expected to employ deictic communication. Our results show that gestures which come into physical contact with the object offer the highest overall communicative accuracy and that specific settings benefit from the use of particular types of gestures. Our results highlight the rich design space for deictic gestures and inform how robots might adapt their gestures to the specific physical, environmental, and task conditions.},

abstract = {When participants follow spoken instructions to pick up and move objects in a visual workspace, their eye movements to the objects are closely time-locked to referential expressions in the instructions. Two experiments used this methodology to investigate the processing of the temporary ambiguities that arise because spoken language unfolds over time. Experiment 1 examined the processing of sentences with a temporarily ambiguous prepositional phrase (e.g., "Put the apple on the towel in the box") using visual contexts that supported either the normally preferred initial interpretation (the apple should be put on the towel) or the less-preferred interpretation (the apple is already on the towel and should be put in the box). Eye movement patterns clearly established that the initial interpretation of the ambiguous phrase was the one consistent with the context. Experiment 2 replicated these results using prerecorded digitized speech to eliminate any possibility of prosodic differences across conditions or experimenter demand. Overall, the findings are consistent with a broad theoretical framework in which real-time language comprehension immediately takes into account a rich array of relevant nonlinguistic context. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

@article{Yang2011,
abstract = {In this article we focus on human-human multi-tasking dialogues, in which pairs of conversants, using speech, work on an ongoing task while occasionally completing real-time tasks. The ongoing task is a poker game in which conversants need to assemble a poker hand, and the real-time task is a picture game in which conversants need to find out whether they have a certain picture on their displays. We employ empirical corpus studies and machine learning experiments to understand the mechanisms that people use in managing these complex interactions. First, we examine task interruptions: switching from the ongoing task to a real-time task. We find that generally conversants tend to interrupt at a less disruptive context in the ongoing task when possible. We also find that the discourse markers oh and wait occur in initiating a task interruption twice as often as in the conversation of the ongoing task. Pitch is also found to be statistically correlated with task interruptions; in fact, the more disruptive the task interruption, the higher the pitch. Second, we examine task resumptions: returning to the ongoing task after completing an interrupting real-time task. We find that conversants might simply resume the conversation where they left off, but sometimes they repeat the last utterance or summarize the critical information that was exchanged before the interruption. Third, we apply machine learning to determine how well task interruptions can be recognized automatically and to investigate the usefulness of the cues that we find in the corpus studies. We find that discourse context, pitch, and the discourse markers oh and wait are important features to reliably recognize task interruptions; and with non-lexical features one can improve the performance of recognizing task interruptions with more than a 50\% relative error reduction over a baseline. Finally, we discuss the implication of our findings for building a speech interface that supports multi-tasking dialogue. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Distributional models have been successful in modelling the meanings of content words, but logical semantics is necessary to adequately represent many function words. We follow formal semantics in mapping language to logical representations, but differ in that the relational constants used are induced by offline distributional clustering at the level of predicate- argument structure. Our clustering algorithm is highly scalable, allowing us to run on corpora the size of Gigaword. Different senses of a word are disambiguated based on their induced types. We outperform a variety of existing approaches on a wide-coverage question answering task, and demonstrate the ability to make complex multi-sentence inferences involving quantifiers on the FraCaS suite.},

abstract = {We present the results of a study of definite descriptions use in written texts aimed at assessing the feasibility of annotating corpora with information about definite description interpretation. We ran two experiments, in which subjects were asked to classify the uses of definite descriptions in a corpus of 33 newspaper articles, containing a total of 1412 definite descriptions. We measured the agreement among annotators about the classes assigned to definite descriptions, as well as the agreement about the antecedent assigned to those definites that the annotators classified as being related to an antecedent in the text. The most interesting result of this study from a corpus annotation perspective was the rather low agreement (K=0.63) that we obtained using versions of Hawkins' and Prince's classification schemes; better results (K=0.76) were obtained using the simplified scheme proposed by Fraurud that includes only two classes, first-mention and subsequent-mention. The agreement about antecedents was also not complete. These findings raise questions concerning the strategy of evaluating systems for definite description interpretation by comparing their results with a standardized annotation. From a linguistic point of view, the most interesting observations were the great number of discourse-new definites in our corpus (in one of our experiments, about 50\% of the definites in the collection were classified as discourse-new, 30\% as anaphoric, and 18\% as associative/bridging) and the presence of definites which did not seem to require a complete disambiguation.},

abstract = {This paper describes a statistically motivated framework for performing real-time dialogue state updates and policy learning in a spoken dialogue system. The framework is based on the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which provides a well-founded, statistical model of spoken dialogue management. However, exact belief state updates in a POMDP model are computationally intractable so approximate methods must be used. This paper presents a tractable method based on the loopy belief propagation algorithm. Various simplifications are made, which improve the efficiency significantly compared to the original algorithm as well as compared to other POMDP-based dialogue state updating approaches. A second contribution of this paper is a method for learning in spoken dialogue systems which uses a component-based policy with the episodic Natural Actor Critic algorithm. The framework proposed in this paper was tested on both simulations and in a user trial. Both indicated that using Bayesian updates of the dialogue state significantly outperforms traditional definitions of the dialogue state. Policy learning worked effectively and the learned policy outperformed all others on simulations. In user trials the learned policy was also competitive, although its optimality was less conclusive. Overall, the Bayesian update of dialogue state framework was shown to be a feasible and effective approach to building real-world POMDP-based dialogue systems. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Their representations of the shared world are misaligned. In order for humans and robots to communicate with each other successfully using language, it is important for them to mediate such differences and to establish common ground. To address this issue, this paper describes a dialogue system that aims to mediate a shared perceptual basis during human-robot dialogue. In particular, we present an empirical study that examines the role of the robot's collaborative effort and the performance of natural language processing modules in dialogue grounding. Our empirical results indicate that in situated human-robot dialogue, a low collaborative effort from the robot may lead its human partner to believe a common ground is established. However, such beliefs may not reflect true mutual understanding. To support truly grounded dialogues, the robot should make an extra effort by making its partner aware of its internal representation of the shared world.},

In doing so they try to minimize their joint effort. The preferred procedure is for the speaker to present a simple noun phrase and for the addressee to accept it by allowing the next contribution to begin. We describe a communication task in which pairs of people conversed about arranging complex figures and show how the proposed model accounts for many features of the references they produced. The model follows, we suggest, from the mutual responsibility that participants in conversation bear toward the understanding of each utterance.

First, a great many of the lexical items that each child produced initially in gesture later moved to that child's verbal lexicon. Second, children who were first to produce gesture-plus-word combinations conveying two elements in a proposition (point at bird and say "nap") were also first to produce two-word combinations ("bird nap"). Changes in gesture thus not only predate but also predict changes in language, suggesting that early gesture may be paving the way for future developments in language.},

The aim of the present work is to provide a humanoid robot with cognitive, perceptual and motor skills fundamental for the acquisition of a rudimentary form of language. We present a novel probabilistic model, inspired by the findings in cognitive sciences, able to associate spoken words with their perceptually grounded meanings. The main focus is set on acquiring the meaning of various perceptual categories (e.g. red, blue, circle, above, etc.), rather than specific world entities (e.g. an apple, a toy, etc.). Our probabilistic model is based on a variant of multi-instance learning technique, and it enables a robotic platform to learn grounded meanings of adjective/noun terms. The systems could be used to understand and generate appropriate natural language descriptions of real objects in a scene, and it has been successfully tested on the NAO humanoid robotic platform.},

abstract = {We propose a mathematical framework for a unification of the distributional theory of meaning in terms of vector space models, and a compositional theory for grammatical types, for which we rely on the algebra of Pregroups, introduced by Lambek. This mathematical framework enables us to compute the meaning of a well-typed sentence from the meanings of its constituents. Concretely, the type reductions of Pregroups are `lifted' to morphisms in a category, a procedure that transforms meanings of constituents into a meaning of the (well-typed) whole. Importantly, meanings of whole sentences live in a single space, independent of the grammatical structure of the sentence. Hence the inner-product can be used to compare meanings of arbitrary sentences, as it is for comparing the meanings of words in the distributional model. The mathematical structure we employ admits a purely diagrammatic calculus which exposes how the information flows between the words in a sentence in order to make up the meaning of the whole sentence. A variation of our `categorical model' which involves constraining the scalars of the vector spaces to the semiring of Booleans results in a Montague-style Boolean-valued semantics.},

Such lexicons can be inefficient when words appear repeatedly with closely related lexical content. In this paper, we introduce factored lexicons, which include both lexemes to model word meaning and templates to model systematic variation in word usage. We also present an algorithm for learning factored CCG lexicons, along with a probabilistic parse-selection model. Evalua- tions on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the approach learns highly accurate parsers, whose generalization performance benefits greatly from the lexical factoring.},

We review five experiments showing that this time-locked characteristic of eye movements provides a detailed profile of the processes that underlie real-time spoken language comprehension. Together, the first four experiments showed that listeners immediately integrated lexical, sublexical, and prosodic information in the spoken input with information from the visual context to reduce the set of referents to the intended one. The fifth experiment demonstrated that a visual referential context affected the initial structuring of the linguistic input, eliminating even strong syntactic preferences that result in clear garden paths when the referential context is introduced linguistically. We argue that context affected the earliest moments of language processing because it was highly accessible and relevant to the behavioral goals of the listener.},

abstract = {Modern visual recognition systems are often limited in their ability to scale to large numbers of object categories. This limitation is in part due to the increasing difficulty of acquiring sufficient training data in the form of labeled images as the number of object categories grows. One remedy is to leverage data from other sources – such as text data – both to train visual models and to constrain their pre- dictions. In this paper we present a new deep visual-semantic embedding model trained to identify visual objects using both labeled image data as well as seman- tic information gleaned from unannotated text. We demonstrate that this model matches state-of-the-art performance on the 1000-class ImageNet object recogni- tion challenge while making more semantically reasonable errors, and also show that the semantic information can be exploited to make predictions about tens of thousands of image labels not observed during training. Semantic knowledge improves such zero-shot predictions achieving hit rates of up to 18\% across thou- sands of novel labels never seen by the visual model.},

abstract = {Spoken language understanding (SLU) aims at extracting meaning from natural language speech. Over the past decade, a variety of practical goal-oriented spoken dialog systems have been built for limited domains. SLU in these systems ranges from understanding predetermined phrases through fixed grammars, extracting some predefined named entities, extracting users' intents for call classification, to combinations of users' intents and named entities. In this paper, we present the SLU system of VoiceTone\&amp;reg; (a service provided by AT\&amp;T where AT\&amp;T develops, deploys and hosts spoken dialog applications for enterprise customers). The SLU system includes extracting both intents and the named entities from the users' utterances. For intent determination, we use statistical classifiers trained from labeled data, and for named entity extraction we use rule-based fixed grammars. The focus of our work is to exploit data and to use machine learning techniques to create scalable SLU systems which can be quickly deployed for new domains with minimal human intervention. These objectives are achieved by 1) using the predicate-argument representation of semantic content of an utterance; 2) extending statistical classifiers to seamlessly integrate hand crafted classification rules with the rules learned from data; and 3) developing an active learning framework to minimize the human labeling effort for quickly building the classifier models and adapting them to changes. We present an evaluation of this system using two deployed applications of VoiceTone\&amp;reg;.},

abstract = {An important component of human-robot interaction is that people need to be able to instruct robots to move to other locations using naturally given directions. When giving directions, people often make mistakes such as labelling errors (e.g., left vs. right) and errors of omission (skipping important decision points in a sequence). Furthermore, people often use multiple levels of granularity in specifying directions, referring to locations using single object landmarks, multiple landmarks in a given location, or identifying large regions as a single location. The challenge is to identify the correct path to a destination from a sequence of noisy, possibly erroneous directions. In our work we cast this problem as probabilistic inference: given a set of directions, an agent should automatically find the path with the geometry and physical appearance to maximize the likelihood of those directions. We use a specific variant of a Markov Random Field (MRF) to represent our model, and gather multi-granularity representation information using existing large tagged datasets. On a dataset of route directions collected in a large third floor university building, we found that our algorithm correctly inferred the true final destination in 47 out of the 55 cases successfully followed by humans volunteers. These results suggest that our algorithm is performing well relative to human users. In the future this work will be included in a broader system for autonomously constructing environmental representations that support natural human-robot interaction for direction giving.},

By an artificial conversational agent we mean a software agent (possibly with embodiment, personality etc.), capable of engaging in conversation with other conversational agents (human or artificial). By a multi-party setting we mean that more than two agents are engaged in the communication or dialogue. Components designed for two-party dialogue management including sequencing and turn management cannot, in general, handle multi-party dialogue phenomena, such as keeping track of the obligations regarding turn management and the rights and obligations to address an issue. We present an SCXML implementation of Issue-Based Dialogue Management, scaled up to handle more than two participants. The QUD-based dialogue manager makes a distinction between distributive questions (to be answered individually by each addressee) and collective questions (to be answered by the addressees collectively), in order to provide the right kind of grounding behaviour and in order to manage correctly the obligations put on the participants of the dialogue. The dialogue manager also features an SCXML implementation of the SSJ turn management model. We find that it is possible to scale up the Issue-Based Dialogue Management model from twoparty to multi-party dialogues, given that distributive and collective readings of questions can be identified.},

However, the sentence vectors of previous models cannot accurately represent visually grounded meaning. We introduce the DT-RNN model which uses dependency trees to embed sentences into a vector space in order to retrieve images that are described by those sentences. Unlike previous RNN-based models which use constituency trees, DT-RNNs naturally focus on the action and agents in a sentence. They are better able to abstract from the details of word order and syntactic expression. DT-RNNs outperform other recursive and recurrent neural networks, kernelized CCA and a bag-of-words baseline on the tasks of finding an image that fits a sentence description and vice versa. They also give more similar representations to sentences that describe the same image.},

Results show that it outperforms methods based on the Hidden Vector State model and Markov Logic Networks, while performance is close to more complex grammar induction techniques. We also show that our method is robust to speech recognition errors, by improving over a handcrafted parser previously used for dialogue data collection.},

The model is introduced both informally and formally, and is applied to a range of languages. Alongside formal definitions, the authors use step-by-step derivations and detailed lexical definitions to illustrate this new form of syntactic analysis and to show how the model can be applied to a broad range of languages. In this way, the reader gets a sense of the rich potential the framework provides for general application to linguistic analysis. In bringing together explanations of knowledge of language, and the way language is used in parsing, the book challenges basic assumptions of linguistic theory, and is an essential read for anyone interested in what it means to know a language.},

Our results show that speaking partners entrain on BPCs; that is, they tend to use simi- lar sets of BPCs; this similarity increases over the course of a dialogue; and this similarity is associated with measures of dialogue coordi- nation and task success.},

Our algorithm is based on a hierarchical maximum entropy Markov model (MEMM). It considers a person's activity as composed of a set of sub-activities, and infers the two-layered graph structure using a dynamic programming approach. We test our algorithm on detecting and recognizing twelve different activities performed by four people in different environments, such as a kitchen, a living room, an office, etc., and achieve an average performance of 84.3\% when the person was seen before in the training set (and 64.2\% when the person was not seen before).},

However, the dialogue state in past work has been limited to a small number of variables, and growing the number of variables in the dialogue state prevents the probability distribution from being updated in real-time. This paper shows how the number of variables composing the dialogue state can be increased while maintaining response times suitable for a spoken dialogue system. Rather than performing exact inference using the joint distribution over all variables, a particle Iter is employed to compute an approximate update. Dialogue states (particles) are sampled, weighted by their agreement with the speech recognition results, and marginalized to produce a new distribution over each variable. Results on a spoken dialogue system for troubleshooting show that a relatively small number of particles are required to achieve performance close to an exact update, enabling the dialogue system to run in realtime.},

Participants judged whether sentences were sensible by making a response that required moving toward or away from their bodies. When a sentence implied action in one direction (e.g., "Close the drawer" implies action away from the body), the participants had difficulty making a sensibility judgment requiring a response in the opposite direction. The ACE was demonstrated for three sentences types: imperative sentences, sentences describing the transfer of concrete objects, and sentences describing the transfer of abstract entities, such as "Liz told you the story." These dataare inconsistent with theories of language comprehension in which meaning is represented as a set of relations among nodes. Instead, the data support an embodied theory of meaning that relates the meaning of sentences to human action.},

abstract = {Until now, speech synthesis has mainly involved reading-style speech. Today, however, text-to-speech systems must provide a variety of styles because users expect these interfaces to do more than just read information. If synthetic voices must be integrated into future technology, they must simulate the way people talk instead of the way people read. Existing knowledge about how disfluencies occur has made it possible to propose a general framework for synthesising disfluencies. We propose a model based on the definition of disfluency and the concept of underlying fluent sentences. The model incorporates the parameters of standard prosodic models for fluent speech with local modifications of prosodic parameters near the interruption point. The constituents of the local models for filled pauses are derived from the analysis corpus, and constituent's prosodic parameters are predicted via linear regression analysis. We also discuss the implementation details of the model when used in a real speech synthesis system. Objective and perceptual evaluations showed that the proposed models outperformed the baseline model. Perceptual evaluations of the system showed that it is possible to synthesise filled pauses without decreasing the overall naturalness of the system, and users stated that the speech produced is even more natural than the one produced without filled pauses. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Experiments comparing the ID3 symbolic learning algorithm with the perceptron and backpropagation neural learning algorithms have been performed using five large, real-world data sets. Overall, backpropagation performs slightly better than the other two algorithms in terms of classification accuracy on new examples, but takes much longer to train. Experimental results suggest that backpropagation can work significantly better on data sets containing numerical data. Also analyzed empirically are the effects of (1) the amount of training data, (2) imperfect training examples, and (3) the encoding of the desired outputs. Backpropagation occasionally outperforms the other two systems when given relatively small amounts of training data. It is slightly more accurate than ID3 when examples are noisy or incompletely specified. Finally, backpropagation more effectively utilizes a distributed output},

abstract = {Grounded language learning, the task of map- ping from natural language to a representation of meaning, has attracted more and more in- terest in recent years. In most work on this topic, however, utterances in a conversation are treated independently and discourse struc- ture information is largely ignored. In the context of language acquisition, this indepen- dence assumption discards cues that are im- portant to the learner, e.g., the fact that con- secutive utterances are likely to share the same referent (Frank et al., 2013). The current pa- per describes an approach to the problem of simultaneously modeling grounded language at the sentence and discourse levels. We com- bine ideas from parsing and grammar induc- tion to produce a parser that can handle long input strings with thousands of tokens, creat- ing parse trees that represent full discourses. By casting grounded language learning as a grammatical inference task, we use our parser to extend the work of Johnson et al. (2012), investigating the importance of discourse con- tinuity in children’s language acquisition and its interaction with social cues. Our model boosts performance in a language acquisition task and yields good discourse segmentations compared with human annotators. 1},

In the presentation phase, one participant ordinarily presents a stretch of speech intended to specify the content of his or her contribution. In the acceptance phase, all the participants work together to establish the mutual belief that everyone else has understood that content well enough for current purposes. The two phases together constitute a unit of conversation we call a contribution. The two phases may each have contributions embedded within them, so conversations consist of both sequential and hierarchical arrangements of contributions. As evidence for these proposals, we examine four types of contributions that occurred in directory enquiries of the telephone company. From this and other evidence, we argue that contributions appear to be a general feature of conversations.},

A test of the procedure using the 2D color space models; RG, rg, HS, YQ and CbCr found that switching between the color spaces resulted in increased tracking performance. In addition, we have proposed a new performance measure for evaluating color-tracking algorithms, which include both accuracy and robustness of the tracking window.

abstract = {Conversations provide rich opportunities for interactive, continuous learning. When some- thing goes wrong, a system can ask for clari- fication, rewording, or otherwise redirect the interaction to achieve its goals. In this pa- per, we present an approach for using con- versational interactions of this type to induce semantic parsers. We demonstrate learning without any explicit annotation of the mean- ings of user utterances. Instead, we model meaning with latent variables, and introduce a loss function to measure how well potential meanings match the conversation. This loss drives the overall learning approach, which in- duces a weighted CCG grammar that could be used to automatically bootstrap the semantic analysis component in a complete dialog sys- tem. Experiments on DARPA Communica- tor conversational logs demonstrate effective learning, despite requiring no explicit mean- ing annotations.},

@phdthesis{Pfeiffer2010,
abstract = {When humans communicate, we use deictic expressions to refer to objects in our surrounding and put them in the context of our actions. In face to face interaction, we can complement verbal expressions with gestures and, hence, we do not need to be too precise in our verbal protocols. Our interlocutors hear our speaking; see our gestures and they even read our eyes. They interpret our deictic expressions, try to identify the referents and – normally – they will understand. If only machines could do alike. The driving vision behind the research in this thesis are multimodal conversational interfaces where humans are engaged in natural dialogues with computer systems. The embodied conversational agent Max developed in the A.I. group at Bielefeld University is an example of such an interface. Max is already able to produce multimodal deictic expressions using speech, gaze and gestures, but his capabilities to understand humans are not on par. If he was able to resolve multimodal deictic expressions, his understanding of humans would increase and interacting with him would become more natural. Following this vision, we as scientists are confronted with several challenges. First, accurate models for human pointing have to be found. Second, precise data on multimodal interactions has to be collected, integrated and analyzed in order to create these models. This data is multimodal (transcripts, voice and video recordings, annotations) and not directly accessible for analysis (voice and video recordings). Third, technologies have to be developed to support the integration and the analysis of the multimodal data. Fourth, the created models have to be implemented, evaluated and optimized until they allow a natural interaction with the conversational interface. To this ends, this work aims to deepen our knowledge of human non-verbal deixis, specifically of manual and gaze pointing, and to apply this knowledge in conversational interfaces. At the core of the theoretical and empirical investigations of this thesis are models for the interpretation of pointing gestures to objects. These models address the following questions: When are we pointing? Where are we pointing to? Which objects are we pointing at? With respect to these questions, this thesis makes the following three contributions: First, gaze-based interaction technology for 3D environments: Gaze plays an important role in human communication, not only in deictic reference. Yet, technology for gaze interaction is still less developed than technology for manual interaction. In this thesis, we have developed components for real-time tracking of eye movements and of the point of regard in 3D space and integrated them in a framework for Deictic Reference In Virtual Environments (DRIVE). DRIVE provides viable information about human communicative behavior in real-time. This data can be used to investigate and to design processes on higher cognitive levels, such as turn-taking, check-backs, shared attention and resolving deictic reference. Second, data-driven modeling: We answer the theoretical questions about timing, direction, accuracy and dereferential power of pointing by data-driven modeling. As empirical basis for the simulations, we created a substantial corpus with highprecision data from an extensive study on multimodal pointing. Two further studies complemented this effort with substantial data on gaze pointing in 3D. Based on this data, we have developed several models of pointing and successfully created a model for the interpretation of manual pointing that achieves a human-like performance level. Third, new methodologies for research on multimodal deixis in the fields of linguistics and computer science: The experimental-simulative approach to modeling – which we follow in this thesis – requires large collections of heterogeneous data to be recorded, integrated, analyzed and resimulated. To support the researcher in these tasks, we developed the Interactive Augmented Data Explorer (IADE). IADE is an innovative tool for research on multimodal interaction based on virtual reality technology. It allows researchers to literally immerse into multimodal data and interactively explore them in real-time and in virtual space. With IADE we have also extended established approaches for scientific visualization of linguistic data to 3D, which previously existed only for 2D methods of analysis (e.g. video recordings or computer screen experiments). By this means, we extended Mc-Neill’s 2D depiction of the gesture space to gesture space volumes expanding in time and space. Similarly, we created attention volumes, a new way to visualize the distribution of attention in 3D environments.},

Traditional CCG lexicons list lexical items that pair words and phrases with syntac- tic and semantic content. Such lexicons can be inefficient when words appear repeatedly with closely related lexical content. In this paper, we introduce factored lexicons, which include both lexemes to model word meaning and templates to model systematic variation in word usage. We also present an algorithm for learning factored CCG lexicons, along with a probabilistic parse-selection model. Evalua- tions on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the approach learns highly accurate parsers, whose generalization performance benefits greatly from the lexical factoring.},

abstract = {Active learning can be used for the maintenance of a deployed spoken dialog system (SDS) that evolves with time and when large collection of dialog traces can be collected on a daily basis. At the spoken language understanding (SLU) level this maintenance process is crucial as a deployed SDS evolves quickly when services are added, modified or dropped. Knowledge-based approaches, based on manually written grammars or inference rules, are often preferred as system designers can modify directly the SLU models in order to take into account such a modification in the service, even if no or very little related data has been collected. However as new examples are added to the annotated corpus, corpus-based methods can then be applied, replacing or in addition to the initial knowledge-based models. This paper describes an active learning scheme, based on an SLU criterion, which is used for automatically updating the SLU models of a deployed SDS. Two kind of SLU models are going to be compared: rule-based ones, used in the deployed system and consisting of several thousands of hand-crafted rules; corpus-based ones, based on the automatic learning of classifiers on an annotated corpus.},

abstract = {Abstract-Contributing to conversation, it is proposed, is accomplished in two phases. In the presentation phase, one participant ordinarily presents a stretch of speech intended to specify the content of his or her contribution. In the acceptance phase, all the participants work together to establish the mutual belief that everyone else has understood that content well enough for current purposes. The two phases together constitute a unit of conversation we call a contribution. The two phases may each have contributions embedded within them, so conversations consist of both sequential and hierarchical arrangements of contributions. As evidence for these proposals, we examine four types of contributions that occurred in directory enquiries of the telephone company. From this and other evidence, we argue that contributions appear to be a general feature of conversations.},

@article{Schlesewsky2004,
abstract = {One of the most basic assumptions regarding language comprehension is that it proceeds incrementally, i.e. by seeking to maximise the degree of interpretation computed with each new word that is encountered. This perspective has often been though to entail that the thematic interpretation of an argument may be derived from its grammatical function, for example, via a preference-strategy associating a subject with a Causer. In the present paper, we argue that these conclusions are not supported by experimental findings. Rather, as we show on the basis of a number of studies using event-related brain potentials (ERPs), the degree of meaning derived from a given sentence fragment (form) during online sentence comprehension differs as a function of the morphological informativeness of the sentential arguments. Finally, we present a new model of sentence comprehension, the Argument Dependency Model (ADM), which is designed to capture these differences in the way that meaning is computed incrementally. Specifically, the ADM assumes that argument processing proceeds via two alternative processing pathways, one of which is syntactic, and the other of which is thematic (interpretive) in nature. Whereas both pathways seek to establish hierarchical relations between arguments, only the thematic pathway allows for incremental interpretation to be maximised. Which of the two pathways is chosen during the comprehension of a given sentence crucially depends on the morphological informativeness (i.e. presence or absence of unambiguous morphological case marking) of the arguments. Consequences for language architecture arising from this model will be discussed. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All right Reserved.},

abstract = {We present a novel statistical approach to semantic parsing, WASP, for constructing a complete, formal meaning representation of a sentence. A semantic parser is learned given a set of sentences annotated with their correct meaning representations. The main innovation of WASP is its use of state-of-the-art statistical machine translation techniques. A word alignment model is used for lexical acquisition, and the parsing model itself can be seen as a syntax-based translation model. We show that WASP performs favorably in terms of both accuracy and coverage compared to existing learning methods requiring similar amount of supervision, and shows better robustness to variations in task complexity and word order.},

A dialog manager is created using this method and evaluated using a second user model created from held-out dialog data.

abstract = {This thesis presents a new modelling framework for dialogue management based on the concept of probabilistic rules. Probabilistic rules are defined as if...then...else constructions associating logical conditions on input variables to probabilistic effects over output variables. These rules function as high-level templates for the generation of a directed graphical model. Their expressive power allows them to represent the probabilistic models employed in dialogue management in a compact and efficient manner. As a consequence, they can drastically reduce the amount of interaction data required for parameter estimation as well as enhance the system’s ability to generalise over unseen situations. Furthermore, probabilistic rules can also be exploited to encode domain-specific constraints and assumptions into statistical models of dialogue, thereby enabling system designers to incorporate their expert knowledge of the problem structure in a concise and human-readable form. Due to their integration of logical and probabilistic reasoning, we argue that probabilistic rules are particularly well suited to devise hybrid models of dialogue management that can account for both the complexity and uncertainty that characterise many dialogue domains. The thesis also demonstrates how the parameters of probabilistic rules can be efficiently es- timated using both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques. In the case of supervised learning, the rule parameters are learned by imitation on the basis of small amounts of Wizard- of-Oz data. Alternatively, rule parameters can also be optimised via trial and error from repeated interactions with a (real or simulated) user. Both learning strategies rely on Bayesian inference to iteratively estimate the parameter values and provide the best fit for the observed interaction data. Three consecutive experiments conducted in a human–robot interaction domain attest to the practical viability of the proposed framework and its advantages over traditional approaches. In particular, the empirical results of a user evaluation with 37 participants show that a dialogue man- ager structured with probabilistic rules outperforms both purely hand-crafted and purely statistical methods on an extensive range of subjective and objective metrics of dialogue quality. The modelling framework presented in this thesis is implemented in a new software toolkit called OpenDial, which is made freely available to the research community and can be used to develop various types of dialogue systems based on probabilistic rules.},

abstract = {Vector-based models of word meaning have become increasingly popular in cognitive science. The appeal of these models lies in their ability to represent meaning simply by using distributional information under the assumption that words occurring within similar contexts are semantically similar. Despite their widespread use, vector-based models are typically directed at representing words in isolation, and methods for constructing representations for phrases or sentences have received little attention in the literature. This is in marked contrast to experimental evidence (e.g., in sentential priming) suggesting that semantic similarity is more complex than simply a relation between isolated words. This article proposes a framework for representing the meaning of word combinations in vector space. Central to our approach is vector composition, which we operationalize in terms of additive and multiplicative functions. Under this framework, we introduce a wide range of composition models that we evaluate empirically on a phrase similarity task.},

One remedy is to leverage data from other sources – such as text data – both to train visual models and to constrain their pre- dictions. In this paper we present a new deep visual-semantic embedding model trained to identify visual objects using both labeled image data as well as seman- tic information gleaned from unannotated text. We demonstrate that this model matches state-of-the-art performance on the 1000-class ImageNet object recogni- tion challenge while making more semantically reasonable errors, and also show that the semantic information can be exploited to make predictions about tens of thousands of image labels not observed during training. Semantic knowledge improves such zero-shot predictions achieving hit rates of up to 18\% across thou- sands of novel labels never seen by the visual model.},

The key idea is to model perceptual meanings as classifiers of perceptual input. Furthermore, we show how perceptual aspects of meaning can be updated as a result of observing language use in interaction, thereby enabling fine-grained semantic plasticity and semantic coordination. This requires a framework where intensions are (i) represented independently of extensions, and (ii) structured objects which can be modified as a result of learning. We use Type Theory with Records (TTR), a formal semantics framework that starts from the idea that information and meaning is founded on our ability to perceive and classify the world, i.e. to perceive objects and situations as being of types. As an example of our approach, we show how a simple classifier of spatial information based on the Perceptron can be cast in TTR.},

Adjustments in types are a feature of the compositional process and account for various phenomena including coercion and copredication.

Researchers are now creating robotic and simulated systems that ground language in machine perception and action, mirroring human abilities. A new kind of computational model is emerging from this work that bridges the symbolic realm of language with the physical realm of real-world referents. It explains aspects of context-dependent shifts of word meaning that cannot easily be explained by purely symbolic models. An exciting implication for cognitive modeling is the use of grounded systems to 'step into the shoes' of humans by directly processing first-person-perspective sensory data, providing a new methodology for testing various hypotheses of situated communication and learning. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A spatial routine is a script composed from a set of primitive operations on sensor data, analogous to Ullman’s visual routines. We hypothesize that a set of primitives that underlie spatial language could be used to succinctly express themeaning of spatial terms in away that can be used to inter- pret natural language commands. This hypothesis is tested by using spatial routines to build a natural language interface to a real-time strategy game, in which a player controls an army of units in a battle. Spatial routines are used as a top down controlmechanismfor the system, providing amapping from natural language commands to system behavior. Although the current implementation has significant limitations as re- vealed in an initial evaluation, we believe that the concept of spatial routines holds promise as a way to ground spatial language semantics in terms of embodied sensory-motor in- teraction.},

@article{harnard:grounding,
abstract = {There has been much discussion recently about the scope and limits of purely symbolic models of the mind and about the proper role of connectionism in cognitive modeling. This paper describes the "symbol grounding problem": How can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made intrinsic to the system, rather than just parasitic on the meanings in our heads? How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated solely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but other meaningless symbols? The problem is analogous to trying to learn Chinese from a Chinese/Chinese dictionary alone. A candidate solution is sketched: Symbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic representations of two kinds: (1) "iconic representations" , which are analogs of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2) "categorical representations" , which are learned and innate feature-detectors that pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their sensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event categories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical representations. Higher-order (3) "symbolic representations" , grounded in these elementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category membership relations (e.g., "An X is a Y that is Z"). Connectionism is one natural candidate for the mechanism that learns the invariant features underlying categorical representations, thereby connecting names to the proximal projections of the distal objects they stand for. In this way connectionism can be seen as a complementary component in a hybrid nonsymbolic/symbolic model of the mind, rather than a rival to purely symbolic modeling. Such a hybrid model would not have an autonomous symbolic "module," however; the symbolic functions would emerge as an intrinsically "dedicated" symbol system as a consequence of the bottom-up grounding of categories' names in their sensory representations. Symbol manipulation would be governed not just by the arbitrary shapes of the symbol tokens, but by the nonarbitrary shapes of the icons and category invariants in which they are grounded.},

abstract = {Open-ended spoken interactions are typi- cally characterised by both structural com- plexity and high levels of uncertainty, making dialogue management in such set- tings a particularly challenging problem. Traditional approaches have focused on providing theoretical accounts for either the uncertainty or the complexity of spo- ken dialogue, but rarely considered the two issues simultaneously. This paper de- scribes ongoing work on a new approach to dialogue management which attempts to fill this gap. We represent the interac- tion as a Partially Observable Markov De- cision Process (POMDP) over a rich state space incorporating both dialogue, user, and environment models. The tractability of the resulting POMDP can be preserved using a mechanism for dynamically con- straining the action space based on prior knowledge over locally relevant dialogue structures. These constraints are encoded in a small set of general rules expressed as a Markov Logic network. The first-order expressivity of Markov Logic enables us to leverage the rich relational structure of the problem and efficiently abstract over large regions of the state and action spaces.},

The semantic frames used in this work are specialized on the task domain from the Berkeley FrameNet set. Experiments are reported on the French MEDIA dialog corpus. For all the data, the manual transcriptions and annotations at the word and concept levels are available. Tests are performed under 3 different conditions raising in difficulty wrt the errors in the word and concept sequence inputs. Three different stochastic models are compared and the results confirm the ability of the proposed probabilistic frameworks to carry out a reliable semantic frame annotation.},

To solve this problem, this paper presents a hybrid approach to improving robustness of the dialog manager by using agenda-based and example-based dialog modeling. This approach can exploit n-best hypotheses to determine the current dialog state in the dialog manager and keep track of the dialog state using a discourse interpretation algorithm based on an agenda graph and a focus stack. Given the agenda graph and multiple recognition hypotheses, the system can predict the next action to maximize multi-level score functions and trigger error recovery strategies to handle exceptional cases due to misunderstandings or unexpected focus shifts. The proposed method was tested by developing a spoken dialog system for a building guidance domain in an intelligent service robot. This system was then evaluated by simulated and real users. The experimental results show that our approach can effectively develop robust dialog management for spoken dialog systems. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Existing algorithms for the generation of referring expres- sions (GRE) try to find a description that uniquely identifies the referent with respect to other enti- ties that are in the current context. Mobile robots, however, act in large-scale space, that is, environ- ments that are larger than what can be perceived at a glance, e.g., an office building with different floors, each containing several rooms and objects. One challenge when referring to elsewhere is thus to in- clude enough information so that the interlocutors can extend their context appropriately. We address this challenge with a method for context construc- tion that can be used for both generating and resolv- ing REs – two previously disjoint aspects.

abstract = {This paper presents an implemented system for recognizing the occurrence of events described by simple spatial-motion verbs in short image sequences. The semantics of these verbs is specified with event-logic expressions that describe changes in the state of force-dynamic relations between the participants of the event. An efficient finite representation is introduced for the infinite sets of intervals that occur when describing liquid and semi-liquid events. Additionally, an efficient procedure using this representation is presented for inferring occurrences of compound events, described with event-logic expressions, from occurrences of primitive events. Using force dynamics and event logic to specify the lexical semantics of events allows the system to be more robust than prior systems based on motion profile.},

abstract = {Dialogue acts model the intent underlying dialogue moves. In natural language tutorial dialogue, student dialogue moves hold important information about knowledge and goals, and are therefore an integral part of providing adaptive tutoring. Automatically classifying these dialogue acts is a challenging task, traditionally addressed with supervised classification techniques requiring substantial manual time and effort. There is growing interest in unsupervised dialogue act classification to address this limitation. This paper presents a novel unsupervised framework, query-likelihood clustering, for classifying student dialogue acts. This framework combines automated natural language processing with clustering and a novel adaptation of an information retrieval technique. Evaluation against manually labeled dialogue acts on a tutorial dialogue corpus in the domain of introductory computer science demonstrates that the proposed technique outperforms existing approaches. The results indicate that this technique holds promise for automatically understanding corpora of tutorial dialogue and for building adaptive dialogue systems.},

This knowledge is exploited to infer complex paths through maps based on natural language descriptions. The approach is based on an analysis of verbal commands in terms of elementary semantic units that are composed to generate a probability distribution over possible spatial paths in a map. An integration mechanism based on dynamic programming guides this language-to-path translation process, ensuring that resulting paths satisfy continuity and smoothness criteria. In the current implementation, parsing of text into semantic units is performed manually. Composition and interpretation of semantic units into spatial paths is performed automatically. In the evaluations, we show that the system accurately predicts the speakers' intended meanings for a range of instructions. This paper provides building blocks for a complete system that, when combined with robust parsing technologies, could lead to a fully automatic spatial language interpretation system.},

Rather than focusing on identity assignment, we make inferring attributes the core problem of recognition. These attributes can be semantic (ldquospottyrdquo) or discriminative (ldquodogs have it but sheep do notrdquo). Learning attributes presents a major new challenge: generalization across object categories, not just across instances within a category. In this paper, we also introduce a novel feature selection method for learning attributes that generalize well across categories. We support our claims by thorough evaluation that provides insights into the limitations of the standard recognition paradigm of naming and demonstrates the new abilities provided by our attribute-based framework.},

abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

Where traditional models learn from linguistic annotation or word distributions, our approach is grounded in the world, learning by apprenticeship from routes through a map paired with English descriptions. Lacking an explicit alignment between the text and the reference path makes it difficult to determine what portions of the language describe which aspects of the route. We learn this correspondence with a reinforcement learning algorithm, using the deviation of the route we follow from the intended path as a reward signal. We demonstrate that our system successfully grounds the meaning of spatial terms like above and south into geometric properties of paths.},

@book{Steedman2000,
abstract = {In this book Mark Steedman argues that the surface syntax of natural languages maps spoken and written forms directly to a compositional semantic representation that includes predicate-argument structure, quantification, and information structure without constructing any intervening structural representation. His purpose is to construct a principled theory of natural grammar that is directly compatible with both explanatory linguistic accounts of a number of problematic syntactic phenomena and a straightforward computational account of the way sentences are mapped onto representations of meaning. The radical nature of Steedman's proposal stems from his claim that much of the apparent complexity of syntax, prosody, and processing follows from the lexical specification of the grammar and from the involvement of a small number of universal rule-types for combining predicates and arguments. These syntactic operations are related to the combinators of Combinatory Logic, engendering a much freer definition of derivational constituency than is traditionally assumed. This property allows Combinatory Categorial Grammar to capture elegantly the structure and interpretation of coordination and intonation contour in English as well as some well-known interactions between word order, coordination, and relativization across a number of other languages. It also allows more direct compatibility with incremental semantic interpretation during parsing.The book covers topics in formal linguistics, intonational phonology, computational linguistics, and experimental psycholinguistics, presenting them as an integrated theory of the language faculty in a form accessible to readers from any of those fields.},

Our system grounds the meaning of an input sentence in terms of visual percepts coming from the robot's sensors in order to send an appropriate command to the PR2 or respond to spatial queries. To perform this grounding, the system recognizes the objects in the scene, determines which spatial relations hold between those objects, and semantically parses the input sentence. The proposed system uses the visual and spatial information in conjunction with the semantic parse to interpret statements that refer to objects (nouns), their spatial relationships (prepositions), and to execute commands (actions). The semantic parse is inherently compositional, allowing the robot to understand complex commands that refer to multiple objects and relations such as: “Move the cup close to the robot to the area in front of the plate and behind the tea box”. Our system correctly parses 94\% of the 210 online test sentences, correctly interprets 91\% of the correctly parsed sentences, and correctly executes 89\% of the correctly interpreted sentences.},

A challenging sub-task of intent detection is the identification of intent bearing phrases from a limited amount of training data, while maintaining the ability to generalize well. We present a new probabilistic topic model for jointly identifying semantic intents and common phrases in spoken language utterances. Our model jointly learns a set of intent dependent phrases and captures semantic intent clusters as distributions over these phrases based on a distance dependent sampling method. This sampling method uses proximity of words utterances when assigning words to latent topics. We evaluate our method on labeled utterances and present several examples of discovered semantic units. We demonstrate that our model outperforms standard topic models based on bag-of-words assumption.},

In both experiments, college students received a spatial description relating a route through an environment. Descriptions differed in terms of the spatial perspective presented, either route or survey, and the degree to which spatial information was determined, either indeterminate, determinate, or overdeterminate. In Exp 1, 109 Ss read the description and in Exp 2, 65 Ss listened to the description and took notes for later use. Results indicate that perspective and determinacy influenced memory and the contents of participants' notes. Perspective influenced the integration of information. The effect of determinacy depended on degree. Indeterminacy influenced use of a mental representation, in particular during wayfinding. Overdeterminacy stressed working memory, thereby influencing many aspects of performance. Findings indicate that perspective and determinacy, which commonly vary in spatial descriptions, influence the ability to efficiently use descriptions. Descriptions are appended.

The former generative models allow to derive basic concept sequences from the word sequences which are in turn augmented with modalities and hierarchical information by the latter discriminative models. To provide efficiently smoothed conditional probability estimates, factored language models with a generalized parallel backoff procedure are used as the network edge implementation. This framework allows a great flexibility in terms of probability representation facilitating the development of the stochastic levels (semantic and lexical) of the system. Experiments are carried out on the French MEDIA task (tourist information and hotel booking). The MEDIA 10k-utterance training corpus is conceptually rich (more than 80 basic concepts) and is provided with a manually segmented annotation. On this complex task, the proposed multi-stage system is shown to offer better performance than the MEDIA'05 evaluation campaign best system (H. Bonneau-Maynard et al., 2006)},

In this paper we show that synthetic voices built with HMM-based speech synthesis techniques from conversational speech data, preserved segmental and prosodic characteristics of frequent conversational speech phenomena. An analysis of an evaluation investigating the perception of quality and speaking style of HMM-based voices confirms that speech with conversational characteristics are instrumental for listeners to perceive successful integration of conversational speech phenomena in synthetic speech.

The model is based on the view of language as goal-directed behavior. We propose that the content of a referring expression can be accounted for by the planning paradigm. Not only does this approach allow the processes of building referring expressions and identifying their referents to be captured by plan construction and plan inference, it also allows us to account for how participants clarify a referring expression by using meta-actions that reason about and manipulate the plan derivation that corresponds to the referring expression. To account for how clarification goals arise and how inferred clarification plans affect the agent, we propose that the agents are in a certain state of mind, and that this state includes an intention to achieve the goal of referring and a plan that the agents are currently considering. It is this mental state that sanctions the adoption of goals and the acceptance of inferred plans, and so acts as a link between understanding and generation.},

Conventional Japanese statistical dependency parsers are mainly based on a probabilistic model, which is not always efficient or scalable. We propose a new method that is simple and efficient, since it parses a sentence deterministically only deciding whether the current segment modifies the segment on its immediate right hand side. Experiments using the Kyoto University Corpus show that the method outperforms previous systems as well as improves the parsing and training efficiency.},

abstract = {Recently, an ensemble speaker and speaking environment modeling (ESSEM) framework was proposed to enhance automatic speech recognition performance under adverse conditions. In the online phase of ESSEM, the prepared environment structure in the offline stage is transformed to a set of acoustic models for the target testing environment by using a mapping function. In the original ESSEM framework, the mapping function parameters are estimated based on a maximum likelihood (ML) criterion. In this study, we propose to use a maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion to calculate the mapping function to avoid a possible over-fitting problem that can degrade the accuracy of environment characterization. For the MAP estimation, we also study two types of prior densities, namely, clustered prior and hierarchical prior, in this paper. On the Aurora-2 task using either type of prior densities, MAP-based ESSEM can achieve better performance than ML-based ESSEM, especially under low SNR conditions. When comparing to our best baseline results, the MAP-based ESSEM achieves a 14.97\% (5.41\% to 4.60\%) word error rate reduction in average at a signal to noise ratio of 0 dB to 20 dB over the three testing sets.},

At the outset, an overview of approaches to pointing$\backslash$nin various Cognitive Sciences is given. Using inter alia assumptions$\backslash$nof Ludwig Wittgenstein, David Kaplan, and Donald Davidson, we establish$\backslash$nsemantic and pragmatic hypotheses concerning the role of pointing$\backslash$nin multi-modal expressions. The semantic hypotheses say: Pointing$\backslash$nuniquely picks out the object referred to. In contrast, the first$\backslash$npragmatic hypothesis maintains that the object pointed at is identified$\backslash$nby a default inference: Since “picking out” implements the idea of$\backslash$nan assignment or an interpretation function that is how we determine$\backslash$nthe difference between semantics and pragmatics. The second pragmatic$\backslash$nhypothesis only attributes a global pragmatic function to pointing,$\backslash$nnamely, that of shifting the focus of attention, which can be viewed$\backslash$nas a precondition for triggering the default inference. We evaluate$\backslash$nthe hypotheses with an annotated and rated corpus of object identification$\backslash$ngames set up in experiments in which body movement tracking techniques$\backslash$nhave been extensively used to generate precise pointing measurements.$\backslash$nDiscussion of hypotheses is based on two models to conceptualize$\backslash$npointing, a ‘pointing ray’ model and a ‘pointing cone’ model. Statistical$\backslash$ninvestigation and computer simulations show that especially distal$\backslash$nareas in the pointing domain falsify the semantic hypotheses. The$\backslash$npragmatic hypotheses win: reference involving pointing rests on a$\backslash$ndefault inference which we specify using the empirical data. The$\backslash$nresults raise numerous problems for classical semantics-pragmatics$\backslash$ninterfaces brought to the fore in the penultimate section, where$\backslash$nwe argue for pre-semantic$\backslash$n$\backslash$npragmatics as well as post-semantic Gricean pragmatics. Finally, we$\backslash$ndiscuss how our empirical pointing model fits into non-classical$\backslash$n(i.e., “situated”) semantics-pragmatics interfaces.

@article{Partee1975,
abstract = {A theory of grammar (syntax \& semantics) is proposed combining the most essential feature of Richard Montague's theory of syntax \& semantics \& the transformational approach to syntax. The resulting theory is closer to Montague than to any of the current versions of transformational grammar; nevertheless, close analogues of most of the rules (both phrase structure \& transformational) formulated by transformationalists can be naturally included in the new theory. Montague's central working premise, carried over here, is that the syntactic rules determining how a sentence is built out of smaller syntactic parts should correspond 1-to-1 with the semantic rules telling how the meaning of a sentence is a function of the meanings of its parts. This idea is not new in either linguistics or philosophy - in philosophy it has its basis in the work of Frege, Tarski, \& Carnap; it is also standard in the treatment of formalized languages; \& in transformational grammar it can be found in Katz \& Fodor's earliest work on semantics (1963). However, with a few exceptions (e.g., Reichenbach, 1947), philosophers before Montague have applied this principle only to describing constructed languages \& have sometimes expressed skepticism as to whether natural languages would even admit of such a description. Linguists, on the other hand, have attempted to apply principles of syntactic-semantic correspondence to natural languages, but their definitions of semantic theory have diverged considerably from the philosophico-logical tradition. Alternative conceptions of semantics are proposed, \& the suggestion that there is no principled reason for linguists to eschew the philosophico-logical conception of semantics is proposed on the basis that there are in fact some good reasons for adopting it. The 2nd \& largest section of the article - primarily for linguists - is devoted to an explication of Montague's approach to syntax \& semantics. In the 3rd section - primarily addressed to philosophers - main features of transformational syntax \& problems raised in various attempts to add semantics to the theory are discussed. HA},

abstract = {Speech and natural language are natural and convenient ways to interact with artificial characters. Current use of language in games, however, is limited to menu systems and inter- player communication. To achieve smooth linguistic commu- nication with synthetic agents, research should focus on how language connects to the situation in which it occurs. Taking account of the physical scene (where is the speaker located, what is around her, when does she speak?) as well as the func- tional aspects of the situation (why did he choose to speak? What are his likely plans?) can disambiguate the linguistic signal in form and content. We present a game environment to collect time synchronized speech and action streams, to visualize these data and to annotate them at different stages of processing. We further sketch a framework for situated speech understanding on such data, taking into account as- pects of the physical situation as well as the plans players follow. Our results show that this combination of influences achieves remarkable improvements over the individual situ- ation models despite the very noisy and spontaneous nature of the speech involved. This work provides a basis for devel- oping characters that use situated natural spoken language to communicate meaningfully with human players. Introduction},

In order to elicit error handling strategies, a speech recogniser was used to corrupt the speech in one direction. This way, data could be collected on how the subjects might recover from speech recognition errors. This method for studying error handling has the advantages that the level of understanding is transparent to the analyser, and the errors that occur are similar to errors in spoken dialogue systems. The results show that when subjects face speech recognition problems, a common strategy is to ask task-related questions that confirm their hypothesis about the situation instead of signalling non-understanding. Compared to other strategies, such as asking for a repetition, this strategy leads to better understanding of subsequent utterances, whereas signalling non-understanding leads to decreased experience of task success. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In prior work, we developed a model of how gaze aversions are employed in conversation to perform these functions. In this paper, we extend the model to apply to conversational robots, enabling them to achieve some of these functions in conversations with people. We present a system that addresses the challenges of adapting human gaze aversion movements to a robot with very different affordances, such as a lack of articulated eyes. This system, implemented on the NAO platform, autonomously generates and combines three distinct types of robot head movements with different purposes: face-tracking movements to engage in mutual gaze, idle head motion to increase lifelikeness, and purposeful gaze aversions to achieve conversational functions. The results of a human-robot interaction study with 30 participants show that gaze aversions implemented with our approach are perceived as intentional, and robots can use gaze aversions to appear more thoughtful and effectively manage the conversational floor.},

abstract = {As interactive voice response systems become more prevalent and provide increasingly more complex functionality, it becomes clear that the challenges facing such systems are not solely in their synthesis and recognition capabilities. Issues such as the coordination of turn exchanges between system and user also play an important role in system usability. In particular, both systems and users have difficulty determining when the other is taking or relinquishing the turn. In this paper, we seek to identify turn-taking cues correlated with human-human turn exchanges which are automatically computable. We compare the presence of potential prosodic, acoustic, and lexico-syntactic turn-yielding cues in prosodic phrases preceding turn changes (smooth switches) vs. turn retentions (holds) vs. backchannels in the Columbia Games Corpus, a large corpus of task-oriented dialogues, to determine which features reliably distinguish between these three. We identify seven turn-yielding cues, all of which can be extracted automatically, for future use in turn generation and recognition in interactive voice response (IVR) systems. Testing Duncan's (1972) hypothesis that these turn-yielding cues are linearly correlated with the occurrence of turn-taking attempts, we further demonstrate that, the greater the number of turn-yielding cues that are present, the greater the likelihood that a turn change will occur. We also identify six cues that precede backchannels, which will also be useful for IVR backchannel generation and recognition; these cues correlate with backchannel occurrence in a quadratic manner. We find similar results for overlapping and for non-overlapping speech. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We describe a statistical approach for modeling dialogue acts in conversational speech, i.e., speech-act-like units such as Statement, Question, Backchannel, Agreement, Disagreement, and Apology. Our model detects and predicts dialogue acts based on lexical, collocational, and prosodic cues, as well as on the discourse coherence of the dialogue act sequence. The dialogue model is based on treating the discourse structure of a conversation as a hidden Markov model and the individual dialogue acts as observations emanating from the model states. Constraints on the likely sequence of dialogue acts are modeled via a dialogue act n-gram. The statistical dialogue grammar is combined with word n-grams, decision trees, and neural networks modeling the idiosyncratic lexical and prosodic manifestations of each dialogue act. We develop a probabilistic integration of speech recognition with dialogue modeling, to improve both speech recognition and dialogue act classification accuracy. Models are trained and evaluated using a large hand-labeled database of 1,155 conversations from the Switchboard corpus of spontaneous human-to-human telephone speech. We achieved good dialogue act labeling accuracy (65\% based on errorful, automatically recognized words and prosody, and 71\% based on word transcripts, compared to a chance baseline accuracy of 35\% and human accuracy of 84\%) and a small reduction in word recognition error.},

By including an explicit Bayesian model of uncertainty and by optimizing the policy via a reward-driven process, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide such a framework. However, exact model representation and optimization is computationally intractable. Hence, the practical application of POMDP-based systems requires efficient algorithms and carefully constructed approximations. This review article provides an overview of the current state of the art in the development of POMDP-based spoken dialog systems.},

Dialogue systems can be modeled effectively using POMDPs, achieving improvements in robustness. However, past research on POMDPs-based dialogue system assumes that the model parameters are known. This limitation can be addressed through model-based Bayesian reinforcement learning, which offers a rich framework for simultaneous learning and planning. However, due to the high complexity of the framework, a major challenge is to scale up these algorithms for complex dialogue systems. In this work, we show that by exploiting certain known components of the system, such as knowledge of symmetrical properties, and using an approximate online planning algorithm, we are able to apply Bayesian RL on a realistic spoken dialogue system domain.},

abstract = {Preparing words in speech production is normally a fast and accurate process. We generate them two or three per second in fluent conversation; and overtly naming a clear picture of an object can easily be initiated within 600 msec after picture onset. The underlying process, however, is exceedingly complex. The theory reviewed in this target article analyzes this process as staged and feed-forward. After a first stage of conceptual preparation, word generation proceeds through lexical selection, morphological and phonological encoding, phonetic encoding, and articulation itself. In addition, the speaker exerts some degree of output control, by monitoring of self-produced internal and overt speech. The core of the theory, ranging from lexical selection to the initiation of phonetic encoding, is captured in a computational model, called WEAVER++. Both the theory and the computational model have been developed in interaction with reaction time experiments, particularly in picture naming or related word production paradigms, with the aim of accounting for the real-time processing in normal word production. A comprehensive review of theory, model, and experiments is presented. The model can handle some of the main observations in the domain of speech errors (the major empirical domain for most other theories of lexical access), and the theory opens new ways of approaching the cerebral organization of speech production by way of high-temporal-resolution imaging.},

abstract = {This paper discusses semantic processing using the Hidden Vector State (HVS) model. The HVS model extends the basic discrete Markov model by encoding context in each state as a vector. State transitions are then factored into a stack shift operation similar to those of a push-down automaton followed by a push of a new preterminal semantic category label. The key feature of the model is that it can capture hierarchical structure without the use of treebank data for training. Experiments have been conducted in the travel domain using the relatively simple ATIS corpus and the more complex DARPA Communicator Task. The results show that the HVS model can be robustly trained from only minimally annotated corpus data. Furthermore, when measured by its ability to extract attribute-value pairs from natural language queries in the travel domain, the HVS model outperforms a conventional finite-state semantic tagger by 4.1\% in F-measure for ATIS and by 6.6\% in F-measure for Communicator, suggesting that the benefit of the HVS model's ability to encode context increases as the task becomes more complex. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This mathematical framework enables us to compute the meaning of a well-typed sentence from the meanings of its constituents. Concretely, the type reductions of Pregroups are `lifted' to morphisms in a category, a procedure that transforms meanings of constituents into a meaning of the (well-typed) whole. Importantly, meanings of whole sentences live in a single space, independent of the grammatical structure of the sentence. Hence the inner-product can be used to compare meanings of arbitrary sentences, as it is for comparing the meanings of words in the distributional model. The mathematical structure we employ admits a purely diagrammatic calculus which exposes how the information flows between the words in a sentence in order to make up the meaning of the whole sentence. A variation of our `categorical model' which involves constraining the scalars of the vector spaces to the semiring of Booleans results in a Montague-style Boolean-valued semantics.},

abstract = {The fundamental claim of this paper is that salience - both visual and linguistic - is an important overarching semantic category structuring visually situated discourse. Based on this we argue that computer systems attempting to model the evolving context of a visually situated discourse should integrate models of visual and linguistic salience within their natural language processing (NLP) framework. The paper highlights the importance of dynamically updating and interrelating visual and linguistic discourse context representations. To support our approach, we have developed a real-time, natural language virtual reality (NLVR) system (called LIVE, for Linguistic Interaction with Virtual Environments) that implements an NLP framework based on both visual and linguistic salience. Within this framework saliency information underpins two of the core subtasks of NLP: reference resolution and the generation of referring expressions. We describe the theoretical basis and architecture of the LIVE NLP framework and present extensive evaluation results comparing the system's performance with that of human participants in a number of experiments. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Speaking using unconstrained natural language is an intuitive and flexible way for humans to interact with robots. Understanding this kind of linguistic input is challenging because diverse words and phrases must be mapped into structures that the robot can understand, and elements in those structures must be grounded in an uncertain environment. We present a system that follows natural language directions by extracting a sequence of spatial description clauses from the linguistic input and then infers the most probable path through the environment given only information about the environmental geometry and detected visible objects. We use a probabilistic graphical model that factors into three key components. The first component grounds landmark phrases such as "the computers" in the perceptual frame of the robot by exploiting co-occurrence statistics from a database of tagged images such as Flickr. Second, a spatial reasoning component judges how well spatial relations such as "past the computers" describe a path. Finally, verb phrases such as "turn right" are modeled according to the amount of change in orientation in the path. Our system follows 60\% of the directions in our corpus to within 15 meters of the true destination, significantly outperforming other approaches.},

abstract = {This paper presents an approach to automatically optimiz- ing the retrieval quality of search engines using clickthrough data. Intuitively, a good information retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking, with less relevant documents following below. While previous ap- proaches to learning retrieval functions from examples exist, they typically require training data generated from relevance judgments by experts. This makes them difficult and ex- pensive to apply. The goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for training, namely the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking. Such clickthrough data is available in abundance and can be recorded at very low cost. Taking a Support Vector Ma- chine (SVM) approach, this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions. From a theoretical perspective, this method is shown to be well-founded in a risk minimiza- tion framework. Furthermore, it is shown to be feasible even for large sets of queries and features. The theoreti- cal results are verified in a controlled experiment. It shows that the method can effectively adapt the retrieval function of a meta-search engine to a particular group of users, out- performing Google in terms of retrieval quality after only a couple of hundred training examples. 1.},

abstract = {An approach is introduced for physically grounded natural language interpretation by robots that reacts appropriately to unanticipated physical changes in the environment and dynamically assimilates new information pertinent to ongoing tasks. At the core of the approach is a model of object schemas that enables a robot to encode beliefs about physical objects in its environment using collections of coupled processes responsible for sensorimotor interaction. These interaction processes run concurrently in order to ensure responsiveness to the environment, while co-ordinating sensorimotor expectations, action planning and language use. The model has been implemented on a robot that manipulates objects on a tabletop in response to verbal input. The implementation responds to verbal requests such as 'Group the green block and the red apple', while adapting in real time to unexpected physical collisions and taking opportunistic advantage of any new information it may receive through perceptual and linguistic channels.

abstract = {Everyday communication involves processing nonverbal emotional cues from auditory and visual stimuli. To characterize whether emotional meanings are processed with category-specificity from speech prosody and facial expressions, we employed a cross-modal priming task (the Facial Affect Decision Task; Pell, 2005a) using emotional stimuli with the same valence but that differed by emotion category. After listening to angry, sad, disgusted, or neutral vocal primes, subjects rendered a facial affect decision about an emotionally congruent or incongruent face target. Our results revealed that participants made fewer errors when judging face targets that conveyed the same emotion as the vocal prime, and responded significantly faster for most emotions (anger and sadness). Surprisingly, participants responded slower when the prime and target both conveyed disgust, perhaps due to attention biases for disgust-related stimuli. Our findings suggest that vocal emotional expressions with similar valence are processed with category specificity, and that discrete emotion knowledge implicitly affects the processing of emotional faces between sensory modalities. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Although we take no stance on which position is to be accepted as final truth with respect to human categorisation and naming, we do point to theoretical constraints that make each position more or less likely and we make clear suggestions on what the best engineering solution would be.

So far this interface layer has been missing in AI. First-order logic and probabilistic graphical models each have some of the necessary features, but a viable interface layer requires combining both. Markov logic is a powerful new language that accomplishes this by attaching weights to first-order formulas and treating them as templates for features of Markov random fields. Most statistical models in wide use are special cases of Markov logic, and first-order logic is its infinite-weight limit. Inference algorithms for Markov logic combine ideas from satisfiability, Markov chain Monte Carlo, belief propagation, and resolution. Learning algorithms make use of conditional likelihood, convex optimization, and inductive logic programming. Markov logic has been successfully a...},

abstract = {The eye independently evolved over 40 times in nature (Fernald, 1997), yet strikingly all animals with developed visual systems actively control their gaze using eye or head movements (Land, 1995; Treue, 2001). Indeed, it can be argued that the most frequent behaviour of human beings is movement of the eyes (Bridgeman, 1992). This ceaseless twitching, as one early researcher described it (Stratton, 1906), is the visual systems solution to the huge amount of available visual information and limited processing resources. The human eye covers a visual field of about 200 , but receives detailed information from only 2 (Levi, Klein, \& Aitsebaomo, 1985).},

A Markov logic network (MLN) is a first-order knowledge base with a weight attached to each formula (or clause). Together with a set of constants representing objects in the domain, it specifies a ground Markov network containing one feature for each possible grounding of a first-order formula in the KB, with the corresponding weight. Inference in MLNs is performed by MCMC over the minimal subset of the ground network required for answering the query. Weights are efficiently learned from relational databases by iteratively optimizing a pseudo-likelihood measure. Optionally, additional clauses are learned using inductive logic programming techniques. Experiments with a real-world database and knowledge base in a university domain illustrate the promise of this approach.},

Current implementations of MLNs do not scale to large real-world data sets, which is preventing their wide-spread adoption. We present Tuffy that achieves scalability via three novel contributions: (1) a bottom-up approach to grounding that allows us to leverage the full power of the relational optimizer, (2) a novel hybrid architecture that allows us to perform AI-style local search efficiently using an RDBMS, and (3) a theoretical insight that shows when one can (exponentially) improve the efficiency of stochastic local search. We leverage (3) to build novel partitioning, loading, and parallel algorithms. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art implementations in both quality and speed on several publicly available datasets.},

These word-learning constraints are sometimes viewed as part of a specifically linguistic endowment. However, several recent computational models suggest concretely how word-learning – constraints included – might emerge from more general aspects of cognition, such as associative learning, attention and rational inference. This article reviews these models, highlighting the link between general cognitive forces and the word-learning they subserve. Ultimately, these cognitive forces might leave their mark not just on language learning, but also on language itself: in constraining the space of possible meanings, they place limits on cross-linguistic semantic variation.},

The current article gives an overview of the symbolic and embodied cognition accounts and shows how meaning induction attributed to a specific statistical process or to activation of embodied representations should be attributed to language itself. Specifically, the performance of LSA can be attributed to the linguistic surface structure, more than special characteristics of the algorithm, and embodiment findings attributed to perceptual simulations can be explained by distributional linguistic information.},

We devise a deterministic transform of CCG-bank canonical derivations into incremental ones, and train our parser on this data.

abstract = {In order to communicate with their users in a natural and effective manner, humanlike robots must seamlessly integrate behaviors across multiple modalities, including speech, gaze, and gestures. While researchers and designers have successfully drawn on studies of human interactions to build models of humanlike behavior and to achieve such integration in robot behavior, the development of such models involves a laborious process of inspecting data to identify patterns within each modality or across modalities of behavior and to represent these patterns as "rules" or heuristics that can be used to control the behaviors of a robot, but provides little support for validation, extensibility, and learning. In this paper, we explore how a learning-based approach to modeling multimodal behaviors might address these limitations. We demonstrate the use of a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) for modeling how humans coordinate speech, gaze, and gesture behaviors in narration and for achieving such coordination with robots. The evaluation of this approach in a human-robot interaction study shows that this learning-based approach is comparable to conventional modeling approaches in enabling effective robot behaviors while reducing the effort involved in identifying behavioral patterns and providing a probabilistic representation of the dynamics of human behavior. We discuss the implications of this approach for designing natural, effective multimodal robot behaviors.},

abstract = {Over the past years, the robotics community has made substantial progress in de- tection and 3D pose estimation of known and unknown objects. However, the question of how to identify objects based on language descriptions has not been investigated in detail. While the computer vision community recently started to investigate the use of attributes for object recognition, these approaches do not consider the task settings typically observed in robotics, where a combination of appearance attributes and object names might be used to identify specific objects in a scene. In this paper, we introduce an approach for identifying objects based on appearance and name attributes. To learn rich RGB-D features needed for at- tribute classification, we extend recently introduced sparse coding techniques so as to automatically learn attribute-specific color and depth features. We use Me- chanical Turk to collect a large data set of attribute descriptions of objects in the RGB-D object dataset. Our experiments show that learned attribute classifiers outperform previous instance-based techniques for object identification. We also demonstrate that attribute-specific features provide significantly better generaliza- tion to previously unseen attribute values, thereby enabling more rapid learning of new attribute values. 1},

abstract = {Traditional dialogue systems use a fixed silence threshold to detect the end of users' turns. Such a simplistic model can result in system behaviour that is both interruptive and unresponsive, which in turn affects user experience. Various studies have observed that human interlocutors take cues from speaker behaviour, such as prosody, syntax, and gestures, to coordinate smooth exchange of speaking turns. However, little effort has been made towards implementing these models in dialogue systems and verifying how well they model the turn-taking behaviour in human-computer interactions. We present a data-driven approach to building models for online detection of suitable feedback response locations in the user's speech. We first collected human-computer interaction data using a spoken dialogue system that can perform the Map Task with users (albeit using a trick). On this data, we trained various models that use automatically extractable prosodic, contextual and lexico-syntactic features for detecting response locations. Next, we implemented a trained model in the same dialogue system and evaluated it in interactions with users. The subjective and objective measures from the user evaluation confirm that a model trained on speaker behavioural cues offers both smoother turn-transitions and more responsive system behaviour. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Grounded language learning, the task of map- ping from natural language to a representation of meaning, has attracted more and more in- terest in recent years. In most work on this topic, however, utterances in a conversation are treated independently and discourse struc- ture information is largely ignored. In the context of language acquisition, this indepen- dence assumption discards cues that are im- portant to the learner, e.g., the fact that con- secutive utterances are likely to share the same referent (Frank et al., 2013). The current pa- per describes an approach to the problem of simultaneously modeling grounded language at the sentence and discourse levels. We com- bine ideas from parsing and grammar induc- tion to produce a parser that can handle long input strings with thousands of tokens, creat- ing parse trees that represent full discourses. By casting grounded language learning as a grammatical inference task, we use our parser to extend the work of Johnson et al. (2012), investigating the importance of discourse con- tinuity in children’s language acquisition and its interaction with social cues. Our model boosts performance in a language acquisition task and yields good discourse segmentations compared with human annotators. 1},

The paper first introduces key notions in language modeling and probabilistic parsing, and briefly reviews some previous approaches to using syntactic structure for language modeling. A lexicalized probabilistic top-down parser is then presented, which performs very well, in terms of both the accuracy of returned parses and the efficiency with which they are found, relative to the best broad-coverage statistical parsers. A new language model which utilizes probabilistic top-down parsing is then outlined, and empirical results show that it improves upon previous work in test corpus perplexity. Interpolation with a trigram model yields an exceptional improvement relative to the improvement observed by other models, demonstrating the degree to which the information captured by our parsing model is orthogonal to that captured by a trigram model. A small recognition experiment also demonstrates the utility of the model.},

Traditional approaches have focused on providing theoretical accounts for either the uncertainty or the complexity of spo- ken dialogue, but rarely considered the two issues simultaneously. This paper de- scribes ongoing work on a new approach to dialogue management which attempts to fill this gap. We represent the interac- tion as a Partially Observable Markov De- cision Process (POMDP) over a rich state space incorporating both dialogue, user, and environment models. The tractability of the resulting POMDP can be preserved using a mechanism for dynamically con- straining the action space based on prior knowledge over locally relevant dialogue structures. These constraints are encoded in a small set of general rules expressed as a Markov Logic network. The first-order expressivity of Markov Logic enables us to leverage the rich relational structure of the problem and efficiently abstract over large regions of the state and action spaces.},

We organize the literature on VSMs according to the structure of the matrix in a VSM. There are currently three broad classes of VSMs, based on term-document, word-context, and pair-pattern matrices, yielding three classes of applications. We survey a broad range of applications in these three categories and we take a detailed look at a specific open source project in each category. Our goal in this survey is to show the breadth of applications of VSMs for semantics, to provide a new perspective on VSMs for those who are already familiar with the area, and to provide pointers into the literature for those who are less familiar with the field.},

We present findings from an empirical study showing that the resulting dialogue system is faster overall than its nonincremental counterpart. Furthermore, the incremental system is preferred to its counterpart – beyond what is accounted for by factors such as speed and accuracy. These results are the first to indicate, from a controlled user study, that successful incremental understanding systems will improve both performance and usability.},

In this work, we propose to enrich the existing classification feature set for domain detection with features computed using the click distribution over a set of clicked URLs from search query click logs (QCLs) of user utterances. Since the form of natural language utterances differs stylistically from that of keyword search queries, to be able to match natural language utterances with related search queries, we perform a syntax-based transformation of the original utterances, after filtering out domain-independent salient phrases. This approach results in significant improvements for domain detection, especially when detecting the domains of web-related user utterances.},

We propose a new computational model used to model friendship status in our data, based on a group sparse model (GSM) with L2,1 norm which is designed to accommodate the sparse and noisy properties of the multi-channel features. Our GSM model achieved the best overall performance compared to a non-sparse linear model (NLM) and a regular sparse linear model (SLM), as well as outperforming human raters. Dyadic features, such as number and length of conversational turns and mutual gaze, in addition to low level features such as F0 and gaze at task, were found to be good predictors of friendship status.},

To resolve semantic ambiguities we propose a situation model that captures as- pects of the physical context of an utterance as well as the speaker’s intentions, in our case represented by recognized plans. In a single, coherent Framework for Understanding Situated Speech (FUSS) we show how these two influences, acting on an ambiguous representation of the speech signal, complement each other to disambiguate form and content of situated speech. This method produces promising results in a game playing environment and leaves room for other types of situation models.},

Motivated by previous psycholinguistic findings, we examine how eye-gaze contributes to reference resolution in such a setting. Specifically, we present an integrated probabilistic framework that combines speech and eye-gaze for reference resolution. We further examine the relationship between eyegaze and increased domain modeling with corresponding linguistic processing. Our empirical results show that the incorporation of eye-gaze significantly improves reference resolution performance. This improvement is most dramatic when a simple domain model is used. Our results also show that minimal domain modeling combined with eye-gaze significantly outperforms complex domain modeling without eye-gaze, which indicates that eye-gaze can be used to potentially compensate a lack of domain modeling for reference resolution.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To retrospectively assess, with three-dimensional rotational angiography, the relationship between packing, complex coils, and angiographic recurrence of aneurysms treated with coils. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Informed consent was waived by the institutional review board that approved the study. Results at follow-up angiography of 255 aneurysms in 223 patients (161 female and 62 male patients; mean age, 48 years) were dichotomized into presence or absence of recurrence. The degree of packing of aneurysms treated with complex coils alone, with complex and helical coils, and with helical coils only was compared for significant differences. With generalized estimating equations analysis, relative risk (RR) for recurrence was calculated for mode of manifestation, duration of follow-up, aneurysm volume, packing, initial angiographic result, percentage of complex coils, aneurysm location, and multiplicity of aneurysms. RESULTS: Follow-up angiography revealed recurrence in 28.6\% of aneurysms at a mean follow-up of 12 months; 5.5\% were amenable to re-treatment. Aneurysms treated with complex and those treated with helical coils only had a mean packing of 27\% and 26\%, respectively. There was no significant difference between packing of aneurysms treated with complex and those treated with helical coils (P = .538). Recurring and stable aneurysms both had a mean packing of 27\%. Generalized estimating equations analysis showed significant differences between duration of follow-up and recurrence (P = .001, RR = 3.39), between aneurysm volume and recurrence (P < .001, RR = 6.15), and between hemorrhagic manifestation and recurrence (P = .002, RR = 3.17). There was no significant difference between packing and recurrence, between initial angiographic result and recurrence, between percentage of complex coils and recurrence, between aneurysm location and recurrence, or between multiplicity of aneurysms and recurrence. CONCLUSION: More angiographic recurrences are detected over time. Complex coils do not augment aneurysm packing. Packing is not related to protection against recurrence.},

abstract = {Proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of rice shoot and root tonoplast-enriched and plasma membrane-enriched membrane fractions were carried out to look at tissue-specific expression, and to identify putative regulatory sites of membrane transport proteins. Around 90 unique membrane proteins were identified, which included primary and secondary transporters, ion channels and aquaporins. Primary H(+) pumps from the AHA family showed little isoform specificity in their tissue expression pattern, whereas specific isoforms of the Ca(2+) pump ECA/ACA family were expressed in root and shoot tissues. Several ABC transporters were detected, particularly from the MDR and PDR subfamilies, which often showed expression in either roots or shoots. Ammonium transporters were expressed in root, but not shoot, tissue. Large numbers of sugar transporters were expressed, particularly in green tissue. The occurrence of phosphorylation sites in rice transporters such as AMT1;1 and PIP2;6 agrees with those previously described in other species, pointing to conserved regulatory mechanisms. New phosphosites were found in many transporters, including H(+) pumps and H(+):cation antiporters, often at residues that are well conserved across gene families. Comparison of root and shoot tissue showed that phosphorylation of AMT1;1 and several further transporters may be tissue dependent.},

abstract = {Coecke, Sadrzadeh, and Clark (arXiv:1003.4394v1 [cs.CL]) developed a compositional model of meaning for distributional semantics, in which each word in a sentence has a meaning vector and the distributional meaning of the sentence is a function of the tensor products of the word vectors. Abstractly speaking, this function is the morphism corresponding to the grammatical structure of the sentence in the category of finite dimensional vector spaces. In this paper, we provide a concrete method for implementing this linear meaning map, by constructing a corpus-based vector space for the type of sentence. Our construction method is based on structured vector spaces whereby meaning vectors of all sentences, regardless of their grammatical structure, live in the same vector space. Our proposed sentence space is the tensor product of two noun spaces, in which the basis vectors are pairs of words each augmented with a grammatical role. This enables us to compare meanings of sentences by simply taking the inner product of their vectors.},

A model for text comprehension based on this notion accounts for the formation of a coherent semantic text base in terms of a cyclical process constrained by limitations of working memory. Furthermore, the model includes macro-operators, whose purpose is to reduce the information in a text base to its gist, that is, the theoretical macrostructure. These opera-tions are under the control of a schema, which is a theoretical formulation of the comprehender's goals. The macroprocesses are predictable only when the control schema can be made explicit. On the production side, the model is con-cerned with the generation of recall and summarization protocols. This process is partly reproductive and partly constructive, involving the inverse operation of the macro-operators. The model is applied to a paragraph from a psycho-logical research report, and methods for the empirical testing of the model are developed.},

abstract = {Probabilistic models such as Bayesian Networks are now in widespread use in spoken dialogue systems, but their scalability to complex interaction domains remains a challenge. One central limitation is that the state space of such models grows exponentially with the problem size, which makes parameter estimation increasingly difficult, especially for domains where only limited training data is available. In this paper, we show how to capture the underlying structure of a dialogue domain in terms of probabilistic rules operating on the dialogue state. The probabilistic rules are associated with a small, compact set of parameters that can be directly estimated from data. We argue that the introduction of this abstraction mechanism yields probabilistic models that are easier to learn and generalise bet- ter than their unstructured counterparts. We empirically demonstrate the benefits of such an approach learning a dialogue policy for a human-robot interaction domain based on a Wizard-of-Oz data set.},

@article{Nivre2008,
abstract = {Parsing algorithms that process the input from left to right and construct a single derivation have often been considered inadequate for natural language parsing because of the massive ambiguity typically found in natural language grammars. Nevertheless, it has been shown that such algorithms, combined with treebank-induced classifiers, can be used to build highly accurate disambiguating parsers, in particular for dependency-based syntactic representations. In this article, we first present a general framework for describing and analyzing algorithms for deterministic incremental dependency parsing, formalized as transition systems. We then describe and analyze two families of such algorithms: stack-based and list-based algorithms. In the former family, which is restricted to projective dependency structures, we describe an arc-eager and an arc-standard variant; in the latter family, we present a projective and a non-projective variant. For each of the four algorithms, we give proofs of correctness and complexity. In addition, we perform an experimental evaluation of all algorithms in combination with SVM classifiers for predicting the next parsing action, using data from thirteen languages. We show that all four algorithms give competitive accuracy, although the non-projective list-based algorithm generally outperforms the projective algorithms for languages with a non-negligible proportion of non-projective constructions. However, the projective algorithms often produce comparable results when combined with the technique known as pseudo-projective parsing. The linear time complexity of the stack-based algorithms gives them an advantage with respect to efficiency both in learning and in parsing, but the projective list-based algorithm turns out to be equally efficient in practice. Moreover, when the projective algorithms are used to implement pseudo-projective parsing, they sometimes become less efficient in parsing (but not in learning) than the non-projective list-based algorithm. Although most of the algorithms have been partially described in the literature before, this is the first comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the algorithms within a unified framework.},

In both experiments, participants viewed, for example, a scene depicting a woman, a wine glass and bottle on the floor, an empty table, and various other objects. In Experiment 1, participants concurrently heard either 'The woman will put the glass on the table' or 'The woman is too lazy to put the glass on the table'. Subsequently, with the scene unchanged, participants heard that the woman 'will pick up the bottle, and pour the wine carefully into the glass.' Experiment 2 was identical except that the scene was removed before the onset of the spoken language. In both cases, eye movements after 'pour' (anticipating the glass) and at 'glass' reflected the language-determined position of the glass, as either on the floor, or moved onto the table, even though the concurrent (Experiment 1) or prior (Experiment 2) scene showed the glass in its unmoved position on the floor. Language-mediated eye movements thus reflect the real-time mapping of language onto dynamically updateable event-based representations of concurrently or previously seen objects (and their locations). ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This research is motivated by the observation that, while current statistical SLU models usually perform accurately for simple, well-formed sentences, error rates increase for more complex, longer, more natural or spontaneous utterances. Furthermore, users familiar with web search usually formulate their information requests as a keyword search query, suggesting that frameworks which can handle both forms of inputs is required. We propose a dependency parsing-based sentence simplification approach that extracts a set of keywords from natural language sentences and uses those in addition to entire utterances for completing SLU tasks. We evaluated this approach using the well-studied ATIS corpus with manual and automatic transcriptions and observed significant error reductions for both intent determination (30\% relative) and slot filling (15\% relative) tasks over the state-of-the-art performances.},

leading to many exciting expectations and new challenges. We summarize
the development of the spoken language technology from both a vertical

perspective. We highlight the introduction of statistical methods in
dealing with language-related problems, as this represents a paradigm
shift in the research field of spoken language processing. Statistical
methods are designed to allow the machine to learn structural
regularities in the speech signal, directly from data, for the purpose
of automatic speech recognition and understanding. Research results in
spoken language processing have led to a number of successful
applications, ranging from dictation software for personal computers and
telephone-call processing systems for automatic call routing, to
automatic sub-captioning for television broadcasts. We analyze the
technical successes that support these applications. Along with an
assessment of the state of the art in this broad technical field, we
also discuss the limitations of the current technology, and point out
the challenges that are ahead. This paper presents an accurate overview

These kinds of systems must perceive, reason, and act about the spatial environment where they are embedded.We formulate the problem in terms of Semi-MarkovDecision Processes and propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach to optimize subbehaviors rather than full behaviors.Because of the vast number of policies that are required to control the interaction in a dynamic environment (e.g., a dialogue system assisting a user to navigate in a building from one location to another), our learning approach is based on two stages: (a) the first stage learns low-level behavior, in advance; and (b) the second stage learns high-level behavior, in real time. For such a purpose we extend an existing algorithm in the literature of reinforcement learning in order to support reusable policies and therefore to perform fast learning. We argue that our learning approach makes the problem feasible, and we report on a novel reinforcement learning dialogue system that performs a joint optimization between dialogue and spatial behaviors.Our experiments, using simulated and real environments, are based on a text-based dialogue system for indoor navigation. Experimental results in a realistic environment reported an overall user satisfaction result of 89\%, which suggests that our proposed approach is attractive for its application in real interactions as it combines fast learning with adaptive and reasonable behavior.},

Our model significantly out-performs the rivals on the task of reconstructing AN vectors not seen in training. A small post-hoc analysis further suggests that, when the model-generated AN vector is not similar to the corpus-observed AN vector, this is due to anomalies in the latter. We show more-over that our approach provides two novel ways to represent adjective meanings, alternative to its representation via corpus-based co-occurrence vectors, both outperforming the latter in an adjective clustering task.},

When some- thing goes wrong, a system can ask for clari- fication, rewording, or otherwise redirect the interaction to achieve its goals. In this pa- per, we present an approach for using con- versational interactions of this type to induce semantic parsers. We demonstrate learning without any explicit annotation of the mean- ings of user utterances. Instead, we model meaning with latent variables, and introduce a loss function to measure how well potential meanings match the conversation. This loss drives the overall learning approach, which in- duces a weighted CCG grammar that could be used to automatically bootstrap the semantic analysis component in a complete dialog sys- tem. Experiments on DARPA Communica- tor conversational logs demonstrate effective learning, despite requiring no explicit mean- ing annotations.},

abstract = {If we can model the cognitive and communicative processes underlying speech, we should be able to better predict what a speaker will do. With this idea as inspiration, we examine a number of prosodic and timing features as potential sources of information on what words the speaker is likely to say next. In spontaneous dialog we find that word probabilities do vary with such features. Using perplexity as the metric, the most informative of these included recent speaking rate, volume, and pitch, and time until end of utterance. Using simple combinations of such features to augment trigram language models gave up to a 8.4\% perplexity benefit on the Switchboard corpus, and up to a 1.0\% relative reduction in word error rate (0.3\% absolute) on the Verbmobil II corpus. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {An important aspect of the interpretation of multimodal messages is the ability to identify when the same object in the world is the referent of symbols in different modalities. To understand the caption of a picture, for instance, one needs to identify the graphical symbols that are referred to by names and pronouns in the natural language text. One way to think of this problem is in terms oft he notion of anaphora; however, unlike linguistic anaphoric inference, in which antecedents for pronouns are selected from a linguistic context, in the interpretation of the textual part of multimodal messages the antecedents ave selected from a graphical context. Under this view, resolving multimodal references is like resolving anaphora across modalities. Another way to see the same problem is to look at pronouns in texts about drawings as deictic. In this second view, the context of interpretation of a natural language term is defined asa set of expressions of a graphical language with well-defined syntax and semantics. Natural language and graphical terms are thought of as standing in a relation of translation similar to the translation relation that holds between natural languages. In this paper a theory based on this second view is presented. In this theory, the relations between multimodal representation and spatial deixis, on the one hand, and multimodal reasoning and deictic inference, on the other, are discussed. An integrated model of anaphoric and deictic resolution in the context of the interpretation of multimodal discourse is also advanced."},

We suggest a new velocity-based algorithm that takes several of the previously known limitations into account. Most important, the new algorithm identifies so-called glissades, a wobbling movement at the end of many saccades, as a separate class of eye movements. Part of the solution involves designing an adaptive velocity threshold that makes the event detection less sensitive to variations in noise level and the algorithm settings-free for the user. We demonstrate the performance of the new algorithm on eye movements recorded during reading and scene perception and compare it with two of the most commonly used algorithms today. Results show that, unlike the currently used algorithms, fixations, saccades, and glissades are robustly identified by the new algorithm. Using this algorithm, we found that glissades occur in about half of the saccades, during both reading and scene perception, and that they have an average duration close to 24 msec. Due to the high prevalence and long durations of glissades, we argue that researchers must actively choose whether to assign the glissades to saccades or fixations; the choice affects dependent variables such as fixation and saccade duration significantly. Current algorithms do not offer this choice, and their assignments of each glissade are largely arbitrary.},
